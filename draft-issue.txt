`index.md` Front-matter not working as expected.


Plugin works great when setting `weight` in articles, but not for section indices.
It could be I am misinterpreting the intended purpose.

## `weight`

**Expected Behavior**: Categories in the nav will be ordered according to the `weight` parameter in the corresponding `index.md` file.

**Actual Behavior**: Weight has no effect on ordering.

## `empty` 

**Expected Behavior**: If set to `True`, corresponding category will be displayed in the nav the same way as if no `index.md` had been provided (i.e. a grouping rather than a rendered page).

**Actual Behavior**: Category has a page rendered (including the front matter).

## `retitled`

**Expected Behavior**: If set to `True`, corresponding category entry in nav will use the name set in `Title`

**Actual Behavior**: Category has a page rendered (including the front matter).
