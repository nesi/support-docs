The NeSI Research Developer Cloud has different image tags that are broken down in the following way

`Public`
:   These images are built and mantained by NeSI, the nameing format is generally `NeSI-FlexiHPC-*` which is then appened with the OS flavor.

    For example `NeSI-FlexiHPC-Ubuntu-Jammy_22.04`

`Private`
:   These are images built and uploaded by the project you are in. Think of these as your images that you have created and uploaded to the Research Developer Cloud

`Shared with Project`
:   These are images that are shared from another project to your project.

`Community`
:   These are images upload by the community/other cloud users that are looking to share their images with the wider Research Cloud users
