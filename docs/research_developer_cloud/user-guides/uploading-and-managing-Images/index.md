FlexiHPC supplies many OS images within the Platform. However should you require a specific version for an OS there is the ability to upload that image to the Flexi HPC platform.

The two ways to add an image are as follows:

- [Upload an Image via the Dashboard](upload-an-image-via-the-dashboard.md)

- [Upload an Image via CLI](upload-an-image-via-cli.md)

When managing images within the FlexiHPC platform we have the same options either via the dashboard or the cli

- [Managing Images via the Dashboard](managing-images-via-the-dashboard.md)

- [Managing Images via CLI](managing-images-via-cli.md)
