Key pairs are SSH credentials that are injected into a FlexiHPC instance when it is launched. These are used to access and manage your instances.

You are able to create a new SSH Key pair on the RDC or import one of your own.


Key pairs can be managed a few ways

- [Create and manage key pairs via the dashboard](create-and-manage-keypairs-with-the-dashboard.md)

- [Create and manage key pairs via CLI](create-and-manage-keypairs-via-cli.md)
