Globus provides logins for NeSI users via their organisation, GitHub,
Google or GlobusID.

1. Sign-Up to Globus
    [Globus Login](https://transfer.nesi.org.nz/), look for your organisation in the
    drop-down box. If your organisation is not present in the drop-down box,
    you can also use any of the available methods - this then becomes your
    primary identity in Globus.

2. Link other Globus identities to your primary identity

    From the Globus docs:

    *Login to a Globus account, via its primary identity or one of its
    linked identities, implies login to the account’s primary identity and
    all identities linked to that account’s primary identity. In other
    words, login to a Globus account potentially grants access to all
    resources accessible via all identities linked to that Globus account’s
    primary identity.*

    If you have other identities in Globus (for example, a GlobusID),
    [link them to your Google ID account](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/link-to-existing/).

!!! warning
    If you had a Globus account before February 2016, that account ID is now
    your "GlobusID".

    Your groups and data-shares are associated with your login so you should
    ensure that your primary identity is the login you will generally use.
