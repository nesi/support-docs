There are 4 dual socket nodes on blade, connected to a single Aries
(switch) chip, and there are 16 Aries chips in a chassis connected to
the backplane. On Māui, this implies each chassis contains 64 nodes, or
2,560 Skylake cores. There are 3 chassis in an XC50 cabinet, and two
XC50 cabinets are an Electrical "group". Māui has 1.5 groups.

The performance characteristics are:

1.  1.  Intra-Chassis
        1.  Backplane
        2.  15 links in the backplane
        3.  Rank 1 (green) Network
        4.  14 Gbps
    2.  Intra-group
        1.  Copper cables
        2.  15 links in 5 connectors
        3.  Rank 2 (black) Network
        4.  14 Gbps
    3.  Inter-group links
        1.  Optical
        2.  10 links in 5 connectors
        3.  Rank 3 (blue) Network
        4.  12.5 Gbps

The centrepiece of the Aries network is dynamic routing through a large
variety of different routes from Aries A to Aries B. Therewith the
effective bandwidth is increased significantly. These dynamic routing on
alternative paths is applied on all 3 levels of the network.
