!!! WARNING  
    Logging in via the "sessions" functionality is not compatible with the new HPC's login procedure.  
    It is recommended to use [OnDemand](https://ondemand.nesi.org.nz/) for file browsing, up and downloading and terminal access if you would normally have used MobaXterm.

!!! prerequisite
     -   Have an [active account and project.](../../Getting_Started/Accounts-Projects_and_Allocations/Creating_a_NeSI_Account_Profile.md)
     - [Download MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html)
     - Followed the steps in [Standard Terminal](Standard_Terminal_Setup.md).

!!! WARNING
    - Some users have reported having issues downloading files using
        MobaXterm 23.6. We suggest using version 23.5 instead.
    - Use the Portable Edition if you don't have administrator rights
        on your machine. This is the recommended way for NIWA
        researchers.
    - Otherwise, choose freely the Portable or Installer Edition.
