> ### Requirements
>
> -   Have your [connection to the NeSI
>     cluster](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000625535-Standard-Terminal-Setup)
>     configured.

For the purposes of connecting to the cluster as specified in
(connecting to cluster) this is **included in the setup**. This page is
meant to show how an equivalent arrangement can be set up for
applications that **cannot make use of your existing tunnel**.

For applications that require a connection to the cluster, but cannot
make multiple hops, or have no way to enter a password it may be
necessary to forward a local connection across to the cluster.

**Local Port:** Any process connecting to `127.0. 0.1:<local port>` on
your local will be forwarded to the remote (in this case, the NeSI
cluster).

**Host Alias:** An alias for the socket of your main connection to the
cluster, `mahuika` or `maui` if you have set up your ssh config file as
described
[here](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000625535).

**Remote Port:** Any process connecting to `127.0. 0.1:<remote port>` on
your remote will be forwarded to your local.

# MobaXterm

> ### Tips
>
> -   MobaXterm has an internal terminal which acts like a linux
>     terminal and can be configured as described in the [Standard
>     Terminal
>     Setup](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000625535). 

MobaXterm has a GUI to setup and launch sessions with port forwarding,
click 'Tools &gt; MobaSSH Tunnel (port forwarding)':

-   specify the lander.nesi.org.nz as SSH server address (right, lower
    box, first line)
-   specify your user name (right, lower box, second line)
-   specify the remote server address, e.g. login.mahuika.nesi.org.nz 
    (right, upper box first line)
