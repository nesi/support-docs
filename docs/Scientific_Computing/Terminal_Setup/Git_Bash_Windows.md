!!! prerequisite Requirements
     -   Have a [NeSI
         account.](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000159715-Creating-a-NeSI-Account)
     -   Be a member of an [active
         project.](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000693896-Applying-to-join-a-NeSI-project)

## First time setup

Git Bash can be downloaded as part of Git
[here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

The login process can be simplified with a few configurations.

1.  Open Git Bash and run `nano ~/.ssh/config` to open your ssh config
    file and add the following (replacing `<username>` with your
    username):

    ``` sl
    Host mahuika
       User <username>
       Hostname login.mahuika.nesi.org.nz
       ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p lander
       ForwardX11 yes
       ForwardX11Trusted yes
       ServerAliveInterval 300
       ServerAliveCountMax 2

    Host maui
       User <username>
       Hostname login.maui.nesi.org.nz
       ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p lander
       ForwardX11 yes
       ForwardX11Trusted yes
       ServerAliveInterval 300
       ServerAliveCountMax 2

    Host lander
       User <username>
       HostName lander.nesi.org.nz
       ForwardX11 yes
       ForwardX11Trusted yes
       ServerAliveInterval 300
       ServerAliveCountMax 2

    Host *
       ControlMaster auto
       ControlPersist 1
    ```

    Close and save with ctrl x, y, Enter

2.  Ensure the permissions are correct by
    running `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config`.

## Usage

Assuming you have followed the setup above you will be able to connect
to the clusters directly using;

``` sl
ssh mahuika
```

or

``` sl
ssh maui
```

As multiplexing is not configured *you will have to enter in your login
credentials every time you open a new terminal or try to move a file.*

``` sl
scp <path/filename> mahuika:~/
```
