##  What is VTune?  

VTune is a **performance** analysis tool.  
It can be used to identify and **analyse** various aspects in both
serial and parallel programs and can be used for both OpenMP and MPI
applications.  
It can be used with a command line interface (**CLI**) or a graphical
user interface (**GUI**).

##  How to use VTune?

  
VTune is available on Mahuika by loading the VTune **module**.

``` sl
$ module spider VTune
Versions:
VTune/2019_update4
VTune/2019_update8
```

First login to Mahuika and then run:

``` sl
module load VTune
```

To use the VTune amplifier command line tool help run:

``` sl
amplxe-cl -help
```



##  How do I profile an application with VTune?  

The hotspot analysis is the most commonly used analysis and generally
the first approach to optimizing an application.

-   Example on Mahuika with the matrix sample.  
    The matrix sample is composed of a pre-built matrix in C++ for
    matrix multiplication.

``` sl
$ ml VTune/2019_update8
$ cp -r /opt/nesi/mahuika/VTune/2019_update8/samples_2019/en/vtune_amplifier/C++/matrix .
$ cd matrix
$ amplxe-cl -collect hotspots ./matrix
```

  
The **amplxe-cl** command collects hotspots data.

The option **collect** specifies the collection experiment to run.  
The option **hotspots** is to collect basic hotspots to have a general
performance overview.  
  
This is the type of output you are going to get:

``` sl
$ amplxe-cl -collect hotspots ./matrix
amplxe: Collection started. To stop the collection, either press CTRL-C or enter from another console window: amplxe-cl -r /scale_wlg_persistent/filesets/home/asav179/o/matrix/r000hs -command stop.

The output one receives the overall elapsed and idle times as well as
the CPU times of the individual functions in descending order (list of
hotspots).  
The utilization of the CPUs is also analyzed and judged.



### Note:

You can run the VTune GUI via Jupyter+VDT to visualise profiling
results.

1.  First launch VDT then open a terminal and cd to directory.
2.  Then run:

``` sl
module load VTune
amplxe-gui --path-to-open <vtune_result_dir>
```
