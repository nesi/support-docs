## New and Improved

-   Adding extra logging when the Jupyter Health Check fails

## Fixed

-   We are now closing user session when the corresponding Jupyter
    server is stopped, to avoid idle sessions to linger on the host

 

If you have any questions about any of the improvements or fixes, please
[contact NeSI
Support](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz "mailto:support@nesi.org.nz").
