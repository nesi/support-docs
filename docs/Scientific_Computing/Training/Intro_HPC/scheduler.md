## Job Scheduler

An HPC system might have thousands of nodes and thousands of users. How do we
decide who gets what and when? How do we ensure that a task is run with the
resources it needs? This job is handled by a special piece of software called
the _scheduler_. On an HPC system, the scheduler manages which jobs run where
and when.

The following illustration compares these tasks of a job scheduler to a waiter
in a restaurant. If you can relate to an instance where you had to wait for a
while in a queue to get in to a popular restaurant, then you may now understand
why sometimes your job do not start instantly as in your laptop.

   alt="Compare a job scheduler to a waiter in a restaurant" %}

The scheduler used in this lesson is {{ site.sched.name }}. Although
{{ site.sched.name }} is not used everywhere, running jobs is quite similar
regardless of what software is being used. The exact syntax might change, but
the concepts remain the same.

## Interactive vs Batch

So far, whenever we have entered a command into our terminals, we have received the response immediately in the same terminal, this is said to be an _interactive session_.

[//]: # TODO ??Diagram??

This is all well for doing small tasks, but what if we want to do several things one after another without without waiting in-between? Or what if we want to repeat a series of command again later?

This is where _batch processing_ becomes useful, this is where instead of entering commands directly to the terminal we write them down in a text file or _script_. Then, the script can be _executed_ by calling it with `bash`.

[//]: # TODO ??Diagram??

Lets try this now, create and open a new file in your current directory called `example_job.sh`.
(If you prefer another text editor than nano, feel free to use that), we will put to use some things we have learnt so far.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} nano example_job.sh
```
{: .language-bash}


```
{% include example_scripts/example_job.sh %}
```
{: .language-bash}

> ## shebang
>
> _shebang_ or _shabang_, also referred to as _hashbang_ is the character sequence consisting of the number sign (aka: hash) and exclamation mark (aka: bang): `#!` at the beginning of a script.  It is used to describe the _interpreter_ that will be used to run the script.  In this case we will be using the Bash Shell, which can be found at the path `/bin/bash`. The job scheduler will give you an error if your script does not start with a shebang.
>
{: .callout}

We can now run this script using
```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} bash example_job.sh
```
{: .language-bash}

```
Loading required package: foreach
Loading required package: iterators
Loading required package: parallel
[1] "Using 1 cpus to sum [ 2.000000e+04 x 2.000000e+04 ] matrix."
[1] "0% done..."
...
[1] "99% done..."
[1] "100% done..."
[1] "Sum is '10403.632886'."
Done!
```
{: .output}

You will get the output printed to your terminal as if you had just run those commands one after another.

> ## Cancelling Commands
>
> You can kill a currently running task by pressing the keys <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.
> If you just want your terminal back, but want the task to continue running you can 'background' it by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>.
> Note, a backgrounded task is still attached to your terminal session, and will be killed when you close the terminal (if you need to keep running a task after you log out, have a look at [tmux](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Cheat_Sheets/tmux-Reference_sheet/)).
{: .callout}

## Scheduled Batch Job

Up until now the scheduler has not been involved, our scripts were run directly on the login node (or Jupyter node).

First lets rename our batch script script to clarify that we intend to run it though the scheduler.

```
mv example_job.sh example_job.sl
```
{: .output}

> ## File Extensions
>
> A files extension in this case does not in any way affect how a script is read,
> it is just another part of the name used to remind users what type of file it is.
> Some common conventions:  
> `.sh`: **Sh**ell Script.  
> `.sl`: **Sl**urm Script, a script that includes a *slurm header* and is intended to be submitted to the cluster.  
> `.out`: Commonly used to indicate the file contains the std**out** of some process.  
> `.err`: Same as `.out` but for std**err**.
{: .callout}

In order for the job scheduler to do it's job we need to provide a bit more information about our script.
This is done by specifying _slurm parameters_ in our batch script. Each of these parameters must be preceded by the special token `#SBATCH` and placed _after_ the _shebang_, but before the content of the rest of your script.

{% include figure.html max-width="100%" caption=""
   file="/fig/parts_slurm_script.svg"
   alt="slurm script is a regular bash script with a slurm header after the shebang" %}

These parameters tell SLURM things around how the script should be run, like memory, cores and time required.

All the parameters available can be found by checking `man sbatch` or on the online [slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html).

> ## Comments

> Comments in UNIX shell scripts (denoted by `#`) are ignored by the bash interpreter.

> > ## Solution

> > The `{{ site.sched.comment }}` parameters are read by slurm when we _submit_ the job. When the job starts,
> > the bash interpreter will ignore all lines starting with `#`.
> >
> > This is similar to the _shebang_ mentioned earlier,
> > when you run your script, the system looks at the `#!`, then uses the program at the subsequent

{: .challenge}

Note that just *requesting* these resources does not make your job run faster,
nor does it necessarily mean that you will consume all of these resources. It
only means that these are made available to you. Your job may end up using less
memory, or less time, or fewer tasks or nodes, than you have requested, and it
will still run.

It's best if your requests accurately reflect your job's requirements. We'll
talk more about how to make sure that you're using resources effectively in a
later episode of this lesson.

Now, rather than running our script with `bash` we _submit_ it to the scheduler using the command `sbatch` (**s**lurm **batch**).

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.submit.name }} {% if site.sched.submit.options != '' %}{{ site.sched.submit.options }} {% endif %}example_job.sl
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/basic-job-script.snip %}

And that's all we need to do to submit a job. Our work is done -- now the
scheduler takes over and tries to run the job for us.

## Checking on Running/Pending Jobs

While the job is waiting
to run, it goes into a list of jobs called the *queue*. To check on our job's
status, we check the queue using the command
`{{ site.sched.status }}` (**s**lurm **queue**). We will need to filter to see only our jobs, by including either the flag `--user <username>` or `--me`.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.me }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/basic-job-status.snip %}

We can see many details about our job, most importantly is it's _STATE_, the most common states you might see are..

- `PENDING`: The job is waiting in the queue, likely waiting for resources to free up or higher prioroty jobs to run.
because other jobs have priority.  
- `RUNNING`: The job has been sent to a compute node and it is processing our commands.  
- `COMPLETED`: Your commands completed successfully as far as Slurm can tell (e.g. exit 0).  
- `FAILED`: (e.g. exit not 0).
- `CANCELLED`:
- `TIMEOUT`: Your job has running for longer than your `--time` and was killed.
- `OUT_OF_MEMORY`: Your job tried to use more memory that it is allocated (`--mem`) and was killed.

## Cancelling Jobs

Sometimes we'll make a mistake and need to cancel a job. This can be done with
the `{{ site.sched.del }}` command.

<!-- ```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.submit.name }} {% if site.sched.submit.options != '' %}{{ site.sched.submit.options }} {% endif %}example_job.sl
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.me }}
```
{: .language-bash} -->

<!-- {% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/terminate-job-begin.snip %} -->

In order to cancel the job, we will first need its 'JobId', this can be found in the output of '{{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.me }}'.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{site.sched.del }} 231964
```
{: .language-bash}

A clean return of your command prompt indicates that the request to cancel the job was
successful.

Now checking `{{ site.sched.status }}` again, the job should be gone.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.me }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/terminate-job-cancel.snip %}

(If it isn't wait a few seconds and try again).

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/terminate-multiple-jobs.snip %}

## Checking Finished Jobs

There is another command `{{ site.sched.hist }}` (**s**lurm **acc**oun**t**) that includes jobs that have finished.
By default `{{ site.sched.hist }}` only includes jobs submitted by you, so no need to include additional commands at this point.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.hist }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/basic-job-status-sacct.snip %}

Note that despite the fact that we have only run one job, there are three lines shown, this because each _job step_ is also shown.
This can be suppressed using the flag `-X`.

> ## Where's the Output?
>
> On the login node, when we ran the bash script, the output was printed to the terminal.
> Slurm batch job output is typically redirected to a file, by default this will be a file named `slurm-<job-id>.out` in the directory where the job was submitted, this can be changed with the slurm parameter `--output`.

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/print-sched-variables.snip %}

[//]: # TODO ??Sacct more info on checking jobs. Checking log files during run.

<!-- 
Resource requests are typically binding. If you exceed them, your job will be
killed. Let's use wall time as an example. We will request 1 minute of
wall time, and attempt to run a job for two minutes.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} nano example_job.sl
```
{: .language-bash}

```
{{ site.remote.bash_shebang }}
{{ site.sched.comment }} {{ site.sched.flag.name }} long_job
{{ site.sched.comment }} {{ site.sched.flag.time }} 00:01 # timeout in HH:MM

echo "This script is running on ... "
sleep 240 # time in seconds
hostname
```
{: .output}

Submit the job and wait for it to finish. Once it is has finished, check the
log file.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.submit.name }} {% if site.sched.submit.options != '' %}{{ site.sched.submit.options }} {% endif %}example_job.sh
{{ site.remote.prompt }} {{ site.sched.status }} {{ site.sched.flag.me }}
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/runtime-exceeded-job.snip %}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/runtime-exceeded-output.snip %}

Our job was killed for exceeding the amount of resources it requested. Although
this appears harsh, this is actually a feature. Strict adherence to resource
requests allows the scheduler to find the best possible place for your jobs.
Even more importantly, it ensures that another user cannot use more resources
than they've been given. If another user messes up and accidentally attempts to
use all of the cores or memory on a node, {{ site.sched.name }} will either
restrain their job to the requested resources or kill the job outright. Other
jobs on the node will be unaffected. This means that one user cannot mess up
the experience of others, the only jobs affected by a mistake in scheduling
will be their own. -->
<!-- ## Other Types of Jobs

Up to this point, we've focused on running jobs in batch mode.
{{ site.sched.name }} also provides the ability to start an interactive session.

There are very frequently tasks that need to be done interactively. Creating an
entire job script might be overkill, but the amount of resources required is
too much for a login node to handle. A good example of this might be building a
genome index for alignment with a tool like [HISAT2][hisat]. Fortunately, we
can run these types of tasks as a one-off with `{{ site.sched.interactive }}`.
