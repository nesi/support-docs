On a high-performance computing system, it is seldom the case that the software
we want to use is available when we log in. It is installed, but we will need
to "load" it before it can run.

Before we start using individual software packages, however, we should
understand the reasoning behind this approach. The three biggest factors are:

- software incompatibilities
- versioning
- dependencies

Software incompatibility is a major headache for programmers. Sometimes the
presence (or absence) of a software package will break others that depend on
it. Two of the most famous examples are Python 2 and 3 and C compiler versions.
Python 3 famously provides a `python` command that conflicts with that provided
by Python 2. Software compiled against a newer version of the C libraries and
then used when they are not present will result in a nasty `'GLIBCXX_3.4.20'
not found` error, for instance.

<!-- I think python is a bad example here as "python 2 and python 3 conflict" sounds like a versioning issue. -->

Software versioning is another common issue. A team might depend on a certain
package version for their research project - if the software version was to
change (for instance, if a package was updated), it might affect their results.
Having access to multiple software versions allows a set of researchers to
prevent software versioning issues from affecting their results.

Dependencies are where a particular software package (or even a particular
version) depends on having access to another software package (or even a
particular version of another software package). For example, the VASP
materials science software may depend on having a particular version of the
FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) software library available for it
to work.

## Environment

Before understanding environment modules we first need to understand what is meant by _environment_.

The environment is defined by it's _environment variables_.

_Environment Variables_ are writable named-variables.

We can assign a variable named "FOO" with the value "bar" using the syntax.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} FOO="bar"
```
{: .language-bash}

Convention is to name fixed variables in all caps.

Our new variable can be referenced using `$FOO`, you could also use  `${FOO}`,
enclosing a variable in curly brackets is good practice as it avoids possible ambiguity.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} $FOO
```
{: .language-bash}

```
-bash: bar: command not found
```
{: .output}

We got an error here because the variable is evalued _in the terminal_ then executed.
If we just want to print the variable we can use the command,

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} echo $FOO
```
{: .language-bash}
```
bar
```
{: .output}

We can get a full list of environment variables using the command,

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} env
```
{: .language-bash}
{% include {{ site.snippets }}/modules/env-output.snip %}

These variables control many aspects of how your terminal, and any software launched from your terminal works.

## Environment Modules

Environment modules are the solution to these problems. A _module_ is a
self-contained description of a software package -- it contains the
settings required to run a software package and, usually, encodes required
dependencies on other software packages.

There are a number of different environment module implementations commonly
used on HPC systems: the two most common are _TCL modules_ and _Lmod_. Both of
these use similar syntax and the concepts are the same so learning to use one
will allow you to use whichever is installed on the system you are using. In
both implementations the `module` command is used to interact with environment
modules. An additional subcommand is usually added to the command to specify
what you want to do. For a list of subcommands you can use `module -h` or
`module help`. As for all commands, you can access the full help on the _man_
pages with `man module`.

### Purging Modules

Depending on how you are accessing the HPC the modules you have loaded by default will be different. So before we start listing our modules we will first use the `module purge` command to clear all but the minimum default modules so that we are all starting with the same modules.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module purge
```
{: .language-bash}

```

The following modules were not unloaded:
   (Use "module --force purge" to unload all):

  1) XALT/minimal   2) slurm   3) NeSI
```
{: .output}

Note that `module purge` is informative. It lets us know that all but a minimal default
set of packages have been unloaded (and how to actually unload these if we
truly so desired).

We are able to unload individual modules, unfortunately within the NeSI system it does not always unload it's dependencies, therefore we recommend `module purge` to bring you back to a state where only those modules needed to perform your normal work on the cluster.

`module purge` is a useful tool for ensuring repeatable research by guaranteeing that the environment that you build your software stack from is always the same. This is important since some modules have the potential to silently effect your results if they are loaded (or not loaded).

### Listing Available Modules

To see available software modules, use `module avail`:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module avail
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/modules/available-modules.snip %}

### Listing Currently Loaded Modules

You can use the `module list` command to see which modules you currently have
loaded in your environment. On {{ site.remote.name }} you will have a few default modules loaded when you login.  

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module list
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/modules/module-list-default.snip %}

## Loading and Unloading Software

You can load software using the `module load` command. In this example we will be using the programming language _R_.

Initially, R is not loaded. We can test this by using the `which`
command. `which` looks for programs the same way that Bash does, so we can use
it to tell us where a particular piece of software is stored.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} which R
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/modules/missing-r.snip %}

The important bit here being:

```
/usr/bin/which: no R in (...)
```

Now lets try loading the R environment module, and try again.

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/modules/module-load-r.snip %}

> ## Tab Completion
>
> The module command also supports tab completion. You may find this the easiest way to find the right software.
{: .callout}

So, what just happened?

To understand the output, first we need to understand the nature of the `$PATH`
environment variable. `$PATH` is a special environment variable that controls
where a UNIX system looks for software. Specifically `$PATH` is a list of
directories (separated by `:`) that the OS searches through for a command
before giving up and telling us it can't find it. As with all environment
variables we can print it out using `echo`.

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/modules/r-module-path.snip %}

You'll notice a similarity to the output of the `which` command. However, in this case,
there are a lot more directories at the beginning. When we
ran the `module load` command, it added many directories to the beginning of our
`$PATH`.

The path to NeSI XALT utility will normally show up first.  This helps us track software usage, but the more important directory is the second one: `/opt/nesi/CS400_centos7_bdw/R/4.2.1-gimkl-2022a/bin` Let's examine what's there:

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/modules/r-ls-dir-command.snip %}

`module load` "loads" not only the specified software, but it also loads software dependencies. That is, the software that the application you load requires to run.

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/modules/software-dependencies.snip %}

Before moving onto the next session lets use `module purge` again to return to the minimal environment.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module purge
```
{: .language-bash}

```
The following modules were not unloaded:
   (Use "module --force purge" to unload all):

  1) XALT/minimal   2) slurm   3) NeSI
```
{: .output}

## Software Versioning

So far, we've learned how to load and unload software packages. However, we have not yet addressed the issue of software versioning. At
some point or other, you will run into issues where only one particular version
of some software will be suitable. Perhaps a key bugfix only happened in a
certain version, or version _X_ broke compatibility with a file format you use.
In either of these example cases, it helps to be very specific about what
software is loaded.

Let's examine the output of `module avail` more closely.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} module avail
```
{: .language-bash}
