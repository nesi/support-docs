NICE DCV is a virtual desktop solution that enables users to run
graphics-intensive OpenGL applications, such as 3D visualisation,
remotely on the HPC. You get full access to your data on the
high-performance file systems, as well as the advanced CPU and GPU
capabilities of the Cray CS clusters Mahuika and Māui Ancil.

NICE DCV sessions can persist for as long as your SLURM resource
allocation is valid - you could launch a session in the morning, start a
complex visualisation job with ParaView or VisIt, disconnect while the
machine is still rendering the graphics, and reconnect in the afternoon
to check how your job is coming along.

Follow the instructions below to set up a new session and connect to it.

## Internet Connection

NICE DCV uses image compression mechanisms to reduce the amount of data
that needs to be transmitted from the HPC to your laptop or desktop
computer. However, data volumes can still become significant for longer
sessions. Please keep this in mind if your internet provider charges by
data volume.

While NICE DCV works reasonably well over a WiFi connection, for best
performance we suggest you use a wired (Ethernet) connection if
possible.

## Creating a new NICE DCV server session

### Logging in

#### On Māui

    1. Connect to the lander node following the instructions
        [here](../../Getting_Started/Accessing_the_HPCs/Choosing_and_Configuring_Software_for_Connecting_to_the_Clusters.md).
        For example:

        ``` sl
        ssh lander
        ```

    2. Connect from the lander node to one of the NICE DCV server
        nodes:

        ``` sl
        ssh w-ndcv01
        ```

#### On Mahuika

    1. Connect to the Mahuika login node:

        ``` sl
        ssh mahuika
        ```

    2. Connect to the NICE DCV server node (not yet available):

        ``` sl
        ssh vgpuwbg005
        ```

### Create a new NICE DCV session

Replace `<session name>` with a
    session name of your choice:

    ``` sl
    dcv create-session <session name>
    ```

## Establishing an SSH tunnel

For security reasons, the NICE DCV nodes are not on the public internet
and so are not directly accessible from your workstation. Therefore, we
must create an SSH tunnel through the NeSI lander node.

### Linux, Mac, or Windows Subsystem for Linux

!!! warning
     If successful, commands to open SSH tunnels will look like they are
     doing nothing (hanging) but it is important to leave them running.
     Once you kill a relevant SSH tunnel connection (e.g. `Ctrl-c`) you
     will no longer be able to connect to your NICE DCV session.

1. On your machine run the following command in your Linux terminal
    emulator (assuming you added the
    [recommended](../Terminal_Setup/Standard_Terminal_Setup.md)
    sections to your `~/.ssh/config` file). This command opens an SSH
    tunnel through the NeSI lander node to the SSH port on w-ndcv01.

### To connect to Māui

    ``` sl
    # The first port number (22222 in this example) can be anything you like > 1024,
    # so long as it's not in use by another service.
    # We have picked 22222 because it's easy to remember, the SSH port being 22.
    ssh -L 22222:w-ndcv01.maui.niwa.co.nz:22 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -N lander
    ```

    If you don't already have another open connection to or through the
    NeSI lander node, you will at this point be prompted for your
    password and your second factor. Enter them in the usual manner.

### To connect to Mahuika

    1. Open an SSH tunnel through the lander node to the Mahuika login
        node.

        ``` sl
        # The tunnel port numbers (10022 in this example) can be anything you like > 1024,
        # so long as neither of them is in use by another service.
        # We have picked 10022 because it's easy to remember, the SSH port being 22.
        ssh -L 10022:login.mahuika.nesi.org.nz:22 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -N lander
        ```

        If you don't already have another open connection to or through
        the NeSI lander node to the Mahuika login node, you will at this
        point be prompted for your password and your second factor.
        Enter them in the usual manner.

    2. In a new terminal, open an SSH tunnel through this existing
        tunnel to Mahuika's NICE DCV node.

        ``` sl
        # The tunnel port numbers (22222 in this example) can be anything you like > 1024,
        # so long as neither of them is in use by another service.
        # We have picked 22222 because it's easy to remember, the SSH port being 22.
        ssh -L 22222:vgpuwbg005:22 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -N -p 10022 -l <nesi_linux_username> localhost
        ```

        If prompted for a first factor, enter it in the usual manner.
        The second factor is optional (you can just press Enter), but if
        you provide a second factor it must be correct.

2. Open a second terminal session, and run the following command in it.

    ``` sl
    # The first port number (28443 in this example) can be anything you like > 1024,
    # so long as it's not in use by another service.
    # We have picked 28443 because it's easy to remember, the NICE DCV port being 8443.
    ssh -L 28443:localhost:8443 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -N -p 22222 -l <nesi_linux_username> localhost
    ```

    You will probably be prompted for a first factor and an optional
    second factor.

    Like the above command, this command will apparently hang if
    successful. Do not interrupt it as it is necessary to hold the port
    open for the server.

### MobaXTerm on Windows

If using MobaXTerm on Windows, set up and then start port forwarding
connections to look like this:

#### To connect to Māui

![2020-02-11\_NICE\_DCV\_tunnels\_in\_MobaXTerm.png](../../assets/images/NICE_DCV_Setup.png)  
When setting up and using the connections, note the following:

#### To connect to Mahuika

A picture is still to come.

-   The numbers of the forward ports (fourth column) are arbitrary so
    long as you set them to be greater than 1024, but the SSH server
    port for the second connection must be the same as the forward port
    for the first connection.
-   The destination port for the first tunnel must be `22` and that for
    the second tunnel must be `8443`.
-   The server port for the first tunnel must be `22`.
-   The tunnel through the lander node must be started before the tunnel
    through localhost can be started.
-   The destination server for the tunnel through the lander node must
    be the NeSI login node where your NICE DCV server is running.

## Connecting to a session

NICE DCV comes with a client for Windows and Linux systems, which can be
downloaded from the [NICE web
pages](http://www.nice-software.com/download/dcv). If you use MacOS, or
if you do not want to install the client, you can also connect to your
NICE DCV session with a modern browser.

Before you proceed, make sure that you have a valid SLURM allocation on
the HPC and that a session has been created.

### Connecting with a Client

To connect with the NICE DCV client software:

1.  Launch the client on your laptop or desktop computer.
2.  Enter the server and session name in the login screen using the
    format `localhost:28443#<session_name>`, or whatever port number you
    used for the second SSH tunnel as an alternative to 28443.
3.  Click on "Connect".
4.  Enter your NeSI Linux username and password.
5.  Click on "Login".

### Connecting with a Browser

To connect with a browser:

1.  Launch the browser or open a new tab
2.  Enter "https://localhost:28443/#&lt;session name&gt;" in the URL
    bar. If you used a port other than 28443 when creating the second
    SSH tunnel, make the necessary modifications to this URL.
3.  You may need to accept the insecure certificate in your browser
    before you can proceed
4.  Enter your HPC account credentials (first factor)
5.  Click on "Login"

## Using the Desktop Environment

You should be presented with a Linux desktop environment after
successful login with the client or browser. You can then use the
application launcher to start an application. You can also launch the
terminal application by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting
"Konsole". This will give you access to the NeSI software stack that
includes various visualisation software
solutions.

## Disconnecting and Stopping a Session

Sessions can persist on the HPC for as long as the SLURM resource
allocation is valid. You can disconnect and reconnect to the session as
often as you like.

### Disconnecting from a session without stopping it

1.  Click on the machine URL in the top-right corner of the NICE DCV
    window
2.  Select "Disconnect"
3.  Close the NICE DCV client or browser window

### Disconnecting and stopping a session

1.  Click on the application launcher icon in the top-left corner of the
    virtual desktop
2.  Click on "Leave"
3.  Click on "Log out"
4.  Confirm the logout in the dialog box that appears
5.  Close the NICE DCV client or browser window

A running session will automatically stop if your SLURM resource
allocation finishes.
