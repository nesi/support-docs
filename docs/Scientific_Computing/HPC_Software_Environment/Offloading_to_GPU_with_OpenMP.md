With OpenMP 4.5, it has become possible to offload computations from the
CPU to a GPU,
see <https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/SC18-BoothTalks-Jost.pdf>

## Example

In the following we show how to achieve this in the case of a reduction
operation involving a large loop:

``` sl
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
int main() {
 int n = 1000000000;
 double total = 0;
#pragma omp target teams distribute \
parallel for map(tofrom: total) map(to: n) reduction(+:total)
 for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
 total += exp(sin(M_PI * (double) i/12345.6789));
 }
 std::cout << "total is " << total << '\n';
}
```

Save the above code in file total.cxx.

Note the pragma

``` sl
#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for map(tofrom: total) \
map(to: n) reduction(+:total)
```

which moves variables `total` and `n` to the GPU and creates teams of
threads to perform the sum operation in parallel. 

## Compile

We'll use the Cray C++ compiler to build the executable but first we
need to load a few modules:

``` sl
module load cray-libsci_acc/18.06.1 craype-accel-nvidia60 \
 PrgEnv-cray/1.0.4 cuda92/blas/9.2.88 cuda92/toolkit/9.2.88
```

(Ignore warning "cudatoolkit &gt;= 8.0 is required").

To compare the execution times between the CPU and GPU version, we build
two executables:

``` sl
CC -h noomp -o total total.cxx
CC -o totalOmpGpu total.cxx
```

with executable `total` compiled with `-h noomp`, i.e. OpenMP turned
off.

## Run

The following commands will submit the runs to the Mahuika queue (note
`--partition=gpu --gres=gpu:1` in the case of the executable that
offloads to the GPU):

``` sl
time srun --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 ./total
time srun --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --partition=gpu --gres=gpu:1 ./totalOmpGpu
```
