# MATLAB via OnDemand

!!! warning

    NeSI OnDemand is in development and accessible to early access users only.
    If you are interested in helping us test it please [contact us](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz).

The docs for MATLAB via Jupyter are [here](../../Interactive_computing_using_Jupyter/MATLAB_via_Jupyter_on_NeSI.md), we'll need to decide what needs to change and what can be copied across.
