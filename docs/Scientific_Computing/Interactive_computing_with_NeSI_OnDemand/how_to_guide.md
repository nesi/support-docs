## How to log in

Go to  [**OnDemand**](https://ondemand.nesi.org.nz/). It will automatically take you to the Tuakiri login screen.

Log in with your institutional credentials.

??? info "First Time Login"

    If you haven't logged into OnDemand or our HPC platforms before, part of the login process will include a step to setup a new 2FA.

    * Select your affiliated institution, and log in using your institutional account. Example below shows the University of Auckland login screen.

    ![ondmenad login 2](../../assets/images/ondemand_login_1.png)

    After logging in, you will be asked to set up an OTP (one-time password). This is an OTP in addition to your institutional 2FA. We are currently enforcing an additional security layer of OTP, as the institutions federated by Tuakiri all have different security policies.

    Scan the barcode with your preferred authenticator app (e.g. Google Authenticator), and enter the one-time code (6 digit number) along with a device name (e.g. my mobile) and Submit and you are good to go.

    Once you have set up an OTP, you will be shown the following screen, where you can enter the 6 digit number from your authenticator app.

    After successfully logging in, you will be presented with the following OnDemand screen.

### OnDemand home page

![OnDemand home](../../assets/images/OOD_desktop.png)

1. <kbd>Files</kbd> <kbd>Home Directory</kbd> : Access to OnDemand file explorer
    - Default landing path for the file explorer is your home directory
    - There is a `00_nesi_projects` directory within home which contains symlinks to all project and nobackup directories you have access to.
    Refer to [Interactive file explorer](#interactive-file-explorer)

2. <kbd>Clusters</kbd>><kbd>>_NeSI HPC Shell Access</kbd>
    - Allows us to access HPC login nodes directly from OnDemand.

3. <kbd>My Interactive Sessions</kbd>
    - List all of the currently running sessions associated with my user account

4. **Applications**
    - Currently available apps for interactive computing.

## How to launch an Application

From the home page, you can click on the app you would like to launch, e.g. JupyterLab, and you will be taken to the following screen.

![OnDemand new form](../../assets/images/OOD_jupyter_form.png)

!!! bell "How much resources to request"

    Ideally start with the least amount of resources and scale accordingly. In other words, be as efficient as possible ☺️

    | Form attributes        | Maximum value |
    | ---------------------- | ------------- |
    | **Number of hours**    | 24            |
    | **Number of cores**    | 4             |
    | **Memory per job(GB**) | 32GB          |

Once the session is ready, you will see a button labeled <kbd>Connect to Jupyter</kbd> (or other app of your choice), which upon clicking will take you to the JupyterLab in this example as seen below:

![OnDemand Apps](../../assets/images/jupyter_apps.png)

## Interactive file explorer

If you would like to access your project or nobackup file system via the Interactive file explorer ( not the terminal), 
please use the <kbd>00_nesi_project</kbd> parent directory which contains symlinks to all file systems you have access to.
