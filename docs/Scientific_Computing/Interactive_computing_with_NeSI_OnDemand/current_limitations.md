# NeSI OnDemand Current limitationsÂ¶

| Limitation                                |  What are the missing functions/commands associated with this|
--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|1. ODemand apps  are not exposed to HPC3 Slurm | Commands such as `sbatch`, `sacct`, `squeue` , `scancel` will not work from OnDemand apps|
|2. Missing user Namespaces in Kubernetes pods which will interfere with some Apptainer operations| Although we can run `apptainer pull` command, `apptainer exec,run,shell` commands can be executed due to missing user Namespaces|

    ðŸ™‹ If you to come across above limitations, please consider switching to a HPC3 login node via `Cluster` > `NeSI HPC Shell access` via OnDemand home page
