# Changes from Jupyter on NeSI

!!! warning

    NeSI OnDemand is in development and accessible to early access users only.
    If you are interested in helping us test it please [contact us](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz).

- JupyterLab is no longer the main user interface but is just another application to be launched via the OnDemand interface
- RStudio, MATLAB and Virtual Desktop applications are accessed directly from OnDemand instead of via JupyterLab
