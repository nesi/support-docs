## Changes

We have removed some of the older NeSI-provided Jupyter kernels:

- Anaconda3 2019.03
- Python 3.7.3
- Python 3.8.1
- R 3.6.1
- R 4.0.1

A new kernel has been added:

- Python 3.11.3

If you were using one of the removed kernels and can't switch to another one,
please [contact us](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz "mailto:support@nesi.org.nz")
and we'll be happy to assist you with setting up a
[custom kernel](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Scientific_Computing/Interactive_computing_using_Jupyter/Jupyter_kernels_Tool_assisted_management/).
