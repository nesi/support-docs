Keras is a modular and extendable API for building neural networks in
Python. Keras is included with TensorFlow. Note that there are
[CPU and](../../Scientific_Computing/Supported_Applications/TensorFlow_on_CPUs.md)
[GPU versions](../../Scientific_Computing/Supported_Applications/TensorFlow_on_GPUs.md) of
TensorFlow, here we'll use TensorFlow 1.10 for GPUs, which is available
as an environment module.

Keras can be used to solve a wide set of problems using artificial
neural networks, including pattern recognition. Ultimately, a neural
network is just a black box that takes input values and computes output
values. Internally, the output values are computed using artificial
neurons, which are modelled after biological neurons. The connections
between neurons have different "weights", which when submitted to
different stimuli will output different signals. With sufficient
training, we can teach a neural network to acquire the correct weights,
i.e. adjust the weights until the desired output is produced.

## Counting dots in images

In this example, we will set up a neural network to count the number of
dots embedded in an image.

### Generating the training and testing datasets

Start by generating images of dots.  We'll generate 1000 images for our
training set and 100 images to test our predictions. On Mahuika type the
following commands to generate the training and testing data sets:

``` sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkienzle/MachineLearning/master/Scripts/ProduceSyntheticData/DrawDots.R
ml R/3.6.1-gimkl-2018b
Rscript DrawDots.R -n 1000 -r 0 -R 5 -s 123 -o train -c train.csv -w 40
Rscript DrawDots.R -n 100 -r 0 -R 5 -s 234 -o test -c test.csv -w 40
```

The images are saved under directories train/ and test/, respectively.
An example of image is test/img49.jpg.

``` sh
display test/img49.jpg
```

![img49.jpg](../../assets/images/Keras.jpg)

which shows five, partially overlapping dots. Note that along with the
images, a comma separated values (csv) file (e.g. train/train.csv)
containing the number of dots (0 to 5) for each image is also saved.

### Installing image processing software

The images need to be slightly manipulated. For instance we expect all
the images to be black and white so we can collapse the red, green and
blue channel into one. We'll need OpenCV to this task:

``` sh
pip install opencv-python --user
```

### Running the model

Our neural network

``` sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkienzle/MachineLearning/master/Scripts/Conv2D/classify.py
```

is encoded in classify.py. It is made of three convolution layers, each
followed by max pooling. The convolution and max pooling layers are
often applied to extract features in images. Finally the image is
flattened as a 1D array and a dense layer, which returns an estimate of
the number of dots as a single floating point number, is added. The
corresponding lines in classify.py look like (Python code):

``` sh
clf = keras.Sequential()
clf.add( keras.layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3,3), strides=(1,1),
                             padding='same', data_format='channels_last', activation='relu') )
clf.add( keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)) )
clf.add( keras.layers.Conv2D(128, kernel_size=(3,3), strides=(1,1),
                             padding='same', data_format='channels_last', activation='relu') )
clf.add( keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)) )
clf.add( keras.layers.Conv2D(256, kernel_size=(3,3), strides=(1,1),
                             padding='same', data_format='channels_last', activation='relu') )
clf.add( keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)) )
clf.add( keras.layers.Flatten() )
clf.add( keras.layers.Dense(1) )
```

We're now ready to train and test our model:

``` sl
#!/bin/bash -e
#SBATCH --job-name keras-dots
#SBATCH --partition gpu
#SBATCH --gres gpu:1
#SBATCH --ntasks 1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 1
#SBATCH --time 00:10:00
#SBATCH --mem 512MB
module load TensorFlow/1.10.1-gimkl-2017a-Python-3.6.3
python classify.py --testDir=test --trainDir=train --save=someResults.png
```

Copy-paste the above and save in file classify.sl. Submit the Slurm
script classify.sl

``` sh
sbatch classify.sl
```

### Looking at the output

Upon completion of the run, expect to find file someResults.png in the
same directory as classify.py. This file contains the predictions for
the first 50 test images, which will vary for each training but the
result will look like:

![someResults.png](../../assets/images/Keras.png)

(The purple images have no dots.) With each image the number of dots is
displayed as well as the value inferred by the model in parentheses. The
inferred values are to be rounded to the nearest integer. Plot titles in
red indicate failures. Among the 100 test images, the correct number of
dots was found in 90 percent of the cases (the accuracy will change with
each training due to the randomness of the process). The predicted
number of dots should be off by no more than one unit in most cases.
