We have built a research cloud computing platform for easier and more adaptable collaboration around research data.
Research teams can use our Research Developer Cloud to develop novel solutions that enable research.

- Cloud-native services: Use our cloud infrastructure and on-demand services to develop and manage custom, interactive solutions.
- Programmable infrastructure: Apply DevOps practices enabled by Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate, measure, collaborate, and learn.
- Partnership-led approaches: Partner with our DevOps specialists to build a platform or tools that can benefit your research community.

Please visit [the Research Developer Cloud user guides](https://support.cloud.nesi.org.nz/user-guides/) to know
more about how to use the system.
