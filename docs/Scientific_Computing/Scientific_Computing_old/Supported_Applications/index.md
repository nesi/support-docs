On **Mahuika**, and **Ancillary** nodes (both Mahuika and Māui) software packages are provided using 'Lmod' an implementation of Environment Modules with [additional features](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/010_user.html).  
A list of available software can be obtained with the `module spider` command.

On **Māui** (XC50), software packages are provided using traditional Environment Modules. No modules are loaded by default.
