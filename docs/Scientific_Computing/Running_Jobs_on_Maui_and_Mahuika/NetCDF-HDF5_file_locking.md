NeSI provides libraries for creating and accessing files in the NetCDF
and HDF5 formats on both Mahuika and Mﾄ「i.

On Mﾄ「i, both libraries are part of the Cray Programming Environment and
can be accessed using the modules
'cray-netcdf'/'cray-netcdf-hdf5parallel', and
'cray-hdf5'/'cray-hdf5-parallel'.

Recent versions of NetCDF and HDF5 (HDF5 1.10.x and newer) use a file
locking feature. This prevents data corruption in rare cases of
single-writer/multiple-reader and multiple writer access patterns.

On our current XC50 platform (Mﾄ「i), **file locking is not yet fully
supported** by Cray's DVS. (DVS allows accessing the parallel file
system GPFS on the XC50 compute nodes).

Accordingly, NetCDF-4 and HDF5 applications that write data from Mﾄ「i
compute nodes need to disable file locking with:

``` sl
export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE
```

If file locking is enabled, HDF5/NetCDF4 applications may experience
errors such as

``` sl
ncdump: /path/to/file.nc: NetCDF: HDF error
```

or

``` sl
Error in EM_FOPEN: NetCDF: HDF error - /path/to/file.nc 
```

or

``` sl
(-101) // Error at HDF5 layer
```

or

``` sl

```

**Important:** As file locking has to be disabled on the XC50, care
should be taken to avoid concurrent reader/writer access in your
application.
