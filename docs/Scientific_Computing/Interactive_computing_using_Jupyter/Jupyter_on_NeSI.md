## Introduction

NeSI supports the use of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) for
[interactive
computing](../../Scientific_Computing/Running_Jobs_on_Maui_and_Mahuika/Slurm_Interactive_Sessions.md).
Jupyter allows you to create notebooks that contain live code,
equations, visualisations and explanatory text. There are many uses for
Jupyter, including data cleaning, analytics and visualisation, machine
learning, numerical simulation, managing [Slurm job
submissions](../../Getting_Started/Next_Steps/Submitting_your_first_job.md)
and workflows and much more.

## Accessing Jupyter on NeSI

Jupyter at NeSI is powered by [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), a
multi-user hub that spawns, manages and proxies multiple instances of
the single-user Jupyter server.

### Access NeSI's JupyterHub here:

<https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz>

When you log in with your [NeSI
credentials](../../Getting_Started/Accessing_the_HPCs/Setting_Up_and_Resetting_Your_Password.md)
you will be taken to the "Server Options" page, where typical job
configuration options can be selected to allocate the resources that
will be used to run Jupyter. Typical jobs, not requesting a GPU, should
be up and running within one to two minutes. Requesting a GPU can
increase this time significantly as there are only a small number of
GPUs available at NeSI.
!!! prerequisite Tip
     If your server appears to not have started within 3 minutes please
     reload the browser window and check again, otherwise contact
     [support@nesi.org.nz](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz?subject=Jupyter%20on%20NeSI).

## Known issues

-   When using *srun* in a Jupyter terminal you may see messages like
    those shown below. The "error" messages are actually just warnings
    and can be ignored; the *srun* command should still work.
    Alternatively, you could run *unset TMPDIR* in the terminal before
    running *srun* to avoid these warnings.

    ``` sl
    $ srun --pty bash
    srun: job 28560743 queued and waiting for resources
    srun: job 28560743 has been allocated resources
    slurmstepd: error: Unable to create TMPDIR [/dev/shm/jobs/28560712]: Permission denied
    slurmstepd: error: Setting TMPDIR to /tmp
    ```

## Jupyter user interface

### JupyterLab

Once your server has started you will be redirected to
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). JupyterLab
is the next generation of the Jupyter user interface and provides a way
to use notebooks, text editor, terminals and custom components together.
If you would prefer to use the classic Notebook interface, then select
"Launch Classic Notebook" from the JupyterLab Help menu, or change the
URL from */lab* to */tree* once the server is running.

### File systems

Your Jupyter server will start in a new directory created within your
home directory for that specific Jupyter job. Within that directory, you
will find symbolic links to your home directory and to the project and
nobackup directories of your active projects. We do not recommend that
you store files in this initial directory because next time you launch
Jupyter you will be starting in a different directory, instead switch to
one of your home, project or nobackup directories first.

### Jupyter terminal

JupyterLab provides a terminal that can be an alternative means of
gaining command line access to NeSI systems instead of using an SSH
client. Some things to note are:

-   when you launch the terminal application some environment modules
    are already loaded, so you may want to run `module purge` 
-   processes launched directly in the JupyterLab terminal will probably
    be killed when you Jupyter session times out

## Ending your interactive session and logging out

To end a JupyterLab session, please select "Hub Control Panel" under the
File menu then "Stop My Server". Finally, click on "Log Out".

![](../../assets/images/Jupyter_on_NeSI.png)
![](../../assets/images/Jupyter_on_NeSI_0.png)

If you click "Log Out" without stopping your server, the server will
continue to run until the Slurm job reaches its maximum wall time.

This means that if you wish to have a session lasting, say, 4 hours
(which is not offered in the "Select walltime" drop-down) then you can
start a 8 hour session and end the job as described above when you are
finished. Alternatively, you can cancel your Jupyter job by running
`scancel 'job_id'` from within the Jupyter terminal when you are done.
Note this will make the page unresponsive as it now has no compute
powering it.

## Installing JupyterLab extensions

JupyterLab supports many extensions that enhance its functionality. At
NeSI we package some extensions into the default JupyterLab environment.
Keep reading if you need to install extensions yourself.

Note, there were some changes related to extensions in JupyterLab 3.0
and there are now multiple methods to install extensions. More details
about JupyterLab extensions can be found
[here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html).
Check the extension's documentation to find out the supported
installation method for that particular extension.

### Installing prebuilt extensions 

If the extension is packaged as a prebuilt extension (e.g. as a pip
package), then you can install it from the JupyterLab terminal by
running:

``` sl
$ pip install --user <packagename>
```

For example, the [Dask
extension](https://github.com/dask/dask-labextension#jupyterlab-30-or-greater)
can be installed with the following:

``` sl
$ pip install --user dask-labextension
```

### Installing source extensions

Installing source extensions requires a rebuild of the JupyterLab web
application. Since this requires write permissions, you will need to set
the JupyterLab [application
directory](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html#advanced-usage)
to a location that you can write to. To do this you need to create a
file named *~/.jupyterlab3\_dir* in your home directory with the full
path to your desired JupyterLab application directory and then run some
commands to initialise the JupyterLab application directory.

Running the following commands will create the JupyterLab application
directory in your home directory:

``` sl
$ module load JupyterLab
$ echo $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/lab > ~/.jupyterlab3_dir
$ export JUPYTERLAB_DIR=$HOME/.local/share/jupyter/lab
$ jupyter lab build
```

These changes will only take effect after relaunching your Jupyter
server and then you should be able to install JupyterLab extensions as
you please.
!!! prerequisite Note
     The above commands will put the JupyterLab application directory in
     your home directory. The application directory often requires at least
     1-2GB of disk space and 30,000 inodes (file count), so make sure you
     have space available in your home directory first (see [NeSI File
     Systems and
     Quotas](../../Storage/File_Systems_and_Quotas/NeSI_File_Systems_and_Quotas.md))
     or request a larger quota.

You could change the path to point to a location in your project
directory, especially if multiple people on your project will share the
same JupyterLab application directory, e.g.:

``` sl
$ module load JupyterLab
$ echo /nesi/project/<project_code>/$USER/jupyter/lab > ~/.jupyterlab_dir
$ export JUPYTERLAB_DIR=/nesi/project/<project_code>/$USER/jupyter/lab
$ jupyter lab build
```

## Log files

The log file of a Jupyter server session is saved either in the project
directory of the project you selected on the "Server Options" JupyterHub
page, or in your home directory, and is named
`.jupyterhub_<username>_<job_id>.log` (note the leading `.` which means
the log file is hidden). If you encounter problems with your Jupyter
session, the contents of this file can be a good first clue to debug the
issue.
