# NeSI Support Documentation

Technical documentation for the NeSI High Performance Computing platform.

!!! note "REANNZ Integration
    On 01 July 2025, the roles, services and technologies of NeSI were integrated into the crown-owned company, Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand (REANNZ), centralising New Zealand’s eResearch infrastructure.

    All NeSI services and support – including these Support Documentation pages and team monitoring the support@nesi.org.nz email – are continuing as you’ve known them. Also, the principles of our policies (Access, Acceptable Use, Security & Privacy, etc.) are carrying over and remain in effect. We'll be in touch if anything changes. If you have any questions about the NeSI-REANNZ integration, {% include "partials/support_request.html" %}
