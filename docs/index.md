## ![Getting connected](//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/85418/c8f68fb4c794d902683e2abdc7a22e20abf4fa82.png) Getting connected

Logging in to NeSI resources is primarily accomplished via SSH (or
"secure shell"). This is a method of getting a command-line interface on
our clusters, which runs a version of the Linux operating system. For
more details on how to connect to our systems, please visit

[Connecting to the NeSI Clusters via
SSH](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001016335)

If that sounds too intimidating, and you would like to try a zero-client
web-browser approach to using NeSI, you can log in to our JupyterHub:
[https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/)

For an introduction to the features of Jupyter on NeSI, check out
[Jupyter on
NeSI](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001555615)

## ![Transferring Files](//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/85418/79671a6d774b40afcb09faac902942fed76cfca8.png) Transferring Files

Small files can be moved to and from NeSI systems inside of Jupyter. SCP
(Secure CoPy) is another common method. If you have a large amount of
data to move, you can schedule transfers via [Globus on
NeSI.](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000576776)\

## ![Submitting Jobs](//theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/85418/c8f68fb4c794d902683e2abdc7a22e20abf4fa82.png) Submitting Jobs

Instructions to be executed by the node(s) assigned to you when your
request for resources can be met by the scheduler -- can get very
complicated, so it's best to refer to the documentation for the software
you want to use to get started.

[Submitting your first
job](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000684396)

We also have a more detailed guide on the batch system that we recommend
new users read. It provides information about scheduling, job submission
and how to write scripts to accomplish various tasks.
