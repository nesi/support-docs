NeSI's national platform facilities are connected to the [REANNZ](https://www.reannz.co.nz/) network, Aotearoa's high-performance national digital network (or NREN).
This national network supports collaboration and contributions to data-intensive and complex science and research initiatives in New Zealand and across the globe.

## How to verify the status of external (wide area network - WAN) connectivity for NeSI

A real-time network status page is available on the REANNZ website as a 'weather map', which shows all traffic across its national network:

<https://weathermap.reannz.co.nz>

From that main "weather map" view, you can drill down to a more detailed view of specific addresses, e.g.

### Wellington (WLG) for NIWA

### Mayoral Drive, Auckland (MDR)

### UoA Tamaki Data Centre (TDC)
