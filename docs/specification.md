# Specification
    
## Structure

Public facing articles are found in the `docs` folder. Any markdown files inside will be rendered, any directory will be subcategories.
Pages can be excluded from being shown in the nav by adding them to `mkdocs.yml: not_in_nav`, as in the case of `includes`.

By default, all categories are a group only (e.g. they have nothing rendered, only children),
However, if the folder contains an `index.md` file, it will be rendered instead.

### Article Name/Location

An articles location is determined by its location in the `docs` directory.
Article file can be nested up to two folders deep, and use the title name, in snake_case.

### Title

Headers should have a blank line before and after.

#### Succession

Article title has the follong succession,

- A title defined in the 'title' meta-data.
- A level 1 Markdown header on the first line of the document body.
- The filename of a document.

Our preference is the opposite (filename > H1 > meta).

#### Filename Rendering

When converting a filename for the nav/title the `.md` will be dropped and 'snake_case' and 'kebab-case' will both be rendered with spaces, e.g. 'Snake case' and 'Kebab case' respectively.

The first letter of the filename will be capitalised, but not any subsiquent words.

(Note: Choose only one for naming convention)

### Sub Headers

Unless setting a title, the first 'real' header will be an H2.
It's fine to have text before the first header if it is relevent to the entire page.

No skipping levels, e.g.

```md
H2
H3
H4
```

never

```md
H2
H4
```

Try to avoid only-child headers (e.g shares a parent with at least one other header)

## Macros

Macros allow use of Jinja filter syntax _inside the mardown files_ allowing for much more flexable templating.
Details [here](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/)

`module load ANSYS/{{ applications.ANSYS.machines.mahuika.versions | last }}`

```md
{% raw %}
`module load ANSYS/{{ applications.ANSYS.machines.mahuika.versions | last }}`
{% endraw %}
```

??? "Fancy Example"
    Our Python modules come prebuilt with the following packages: 
    {% set pyexts=applications.Python.extensions.split(', ') %}
    <table>
    <tr><th>Package</th></tr>
    {% for pyext in pyexts %}
    <tr><td>{{ pyext }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
    </table>

    ```md
    {% raw %}

    <tr><td>{{ pyext }}</td></tr>
    {% endfor %}
    {% endraw %}
    </table>
    ```

### Includes

The macro plugin also allows the use of 'includes',

```md
{% raw %}
{% include 'snippet.md' %}
{% endraw %}
```

There are a few includes you may want to use.

| Path | content | usage |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| ```{% raw %}{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}{% endraw %}``` | ```<a href="mailto:support@nesi.org.nz">Contact our Support Team</a>``` | Anywhere the user is told to contact support. |
| ```{% raw %}{% include "partials/appHeader.html" %}{% endraw %}``` | Info block | At the top of documents about particular software (TODO: elaborate) |
| ```{% raw %}{% include "partials/appNetworkLicence.html" %}{% endraw %}``` | List of network licences | When dynamic licence info is required (used in `appHeader.html`)  |
| ```{% raw %}{% include "partials/appVersion.html" %}{% endraw %}``` | List of versions and a 'module load' codeblock. | When dynamic version info is required |
