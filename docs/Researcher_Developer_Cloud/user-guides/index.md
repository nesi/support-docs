# Features

We want to partner with early access users to explore and build scalable approaches for harnessing cloud technologies and DevOps practices in computational research.

Our platform's building blocks include:

`Compute`
:   Virtual machines optimised for high-performance computational needs. Multiple flavours of CPU and GPU resources to support a range of compute and memory requirements.

    → Get started with our [Compute User Guides](launch-and-manage-instances/index.md)

`Images`
:   Tailored operating systems to meet your research computing and data needs. Ready-to-use options available, as well as capability to create custom images and contribute to a pool of community-developed images.

    → Get started with our [Images User Guides](uploading-and-managing-Images/index.md)

`Storage`
:   Scalable storage space that can be dynamically mounted to your Compute instances. Options to encrypt storage volumes for added security.

    → Get started with our [Storage User Guides](create-and-manage-volumes/index.md)

`Networks`
:   Fast, reliable, and secure connectivity built on the REANNZ national network. Options for network customisation and security groups.

    → Get started with our [Networks User Guides](create-and-manage-networks/index.md)

`Identity`
:   Identity management services to create application credentials and control access to projects.

    → Get started with our [Identity User Guides](create-and-manage-identity/index.md)

`Object Storage`
:   Openstack S3 compatiable object storage.

    → Get started with our [Object Storage User Guides](create-and-manage-object-storage/index.md)

`Application Programming Interface (API)`
:   All services are programmable via a public API to enable repeatable definition of infrastructure through software code.
