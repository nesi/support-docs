## Main navigation

The main navigation is in the sidebar and links to important functions
can be found at the bottom of the sidebar.

### Breadcrumb navigation

A breadcrumb navigation is displayed when viewing sections of the
site.  
Example: Home / Projects / List Project

## Collapsible elements

The triple bar (or hamburger) icons allow elements to be collapsed or
revealed. The left icon does collapse the sidebar and therefore hides
the navigation elements contained.  
The triple bar on the right is used for future functions.

The **&lt;** arrow icon on the bottom of the sidebar does minimise the
sidebar by reducing the visible content to icons only.

## Closing the session

The 'user name menu' on the top right contains the option to logout and
close the session.
