!!! prerequisite Requirements
     -   You must have a [NeSI
         account](../../Getting_Started/Accounts-Projects_and_Allocations/Creating_a_NeSI_Account_Profile).

## How to join an existing project on NeSI

1.  Make sure you have been given the project code by the project owner.
2.  Log in to [my.nesi.org.nz](https://my.nesi.org.nz/).
3.  Under the [Projects](https://my.nesi.org.nz/projects/join) page use
    the "**Join Project**" link to request to be added to the project as
    a member.

Once submitted you will receive a ticket confirmation via email.
!!! prerequisite What Next?
     -   The project owner will be notified, and asked to approve your
         request.
     -   Once your request has been approved by the project owner and
         processed by us, you will be able to [set your NeSI account
         password](../../Getting_Started/Accessing_the_HPCs/Setting_Up_and_Resetting_Your_Password).
