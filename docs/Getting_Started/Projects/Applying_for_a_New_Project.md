!!! prerequisite
    - Have a [Account profile](../Creating_an_Account.md).

!!! note "Preferred"
    - Assemble your project team.
    - Becoming familiar with the Linux command line. There are many
         courses and online materials available, such as [Software
         Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), to help
         you and your project team gain the necessary skills.
    - Become familiar with foundational HPC skills, for example by
         watching our introductory webinar, [watching the recorded introductory webinars](../Getting_Help/Introduction_to_computing_on_the_NeSI_HPC.md),
         or having one or more of your project team members do so.
    - Review our [allocation classes](../../Policy/Allocation_classes.md). If
         you don't think you currently qualify for any class other than
         Proposal Development, please {% include "partials/support_request.html" %} as soon as
         possible to discuss your options. Your institution may be in a
         position to buy a subscription from us while your Proposal
         Development allocation is in effect if they do not already possess
         one.

Requests to use REANNZ HPC resources are [submitted via a web
form](https://my.nesi.org.nz/). Our team will endeavour to approve
your project, or contact you for more information, within 3-5 working
days of your submitting your project request.


## Information you will need to provide

During the application process, we will ask you for the following
information:

- Your name, institutional affiliation (i.e. your employer or place of
    study), role at your institution, a contact telephone number, and
    work email address
- The title of your proposed HPC Project, and a brief abstract
    describing your project's goals
- The scientific domain and field of study (i.e. subdomain) your
    project belongs to
- The date on which you plan to start your computational work on NeSI
    (not the start date of the research programme as a whole, or of the
    research programme's current or expected funding)
- Details of how your project is funded (this will help determine
    whether you are eligible for an allocation from our
    [Merit](../../Policy/Allocation_classes.md#merit) class)
- Your previous HPC experience
- Whether you would like expert scientific programming support on your
    project
- Who else will be working on the proposed HPC Project with you
- What software you intend to use on our HPC platforms.

You will also be given an opportunity to tell us anything else you think
is relevant.

!!! prerequisite "What Next?"
     - Your HPC Project proposal will be
         [reviewed](../../Policy/How_we_review_applications.md),
         after which you will be informed of the outcome.
     - We may contact you if further details are required.
     - When your project is approved you will be able to [login for the first time](../Accessing_the_HPCs/First_Time_Login.md).
