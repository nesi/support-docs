NeSI recognises that research programmes often continue over several
years before coming to an end. To reduce administrative overhead, we
allow most project teams to extend their projects rather than applying
for a new project to carry on the same work.

We currently offer two sorts of extensions:

-   A new allocation of computing resources (usually compute units on
    Mahuika or node hours on Māui)
-   A project extension without a new allocation of computing resources.

## Will my project qualify for an extension?

Usually, yes. There are a few circumstances in which a project will not
qualify for an extension:

-   If there has been a substantial change to the research programme's
    goals.
-   If there has been (or is about to be) a substantial change to the
    computational methods the project team plans on using to carry out
    the project work, such that we decide a new technical assessment is
    warranted.
-   If the project team is no longer eligible to receive computing
    resources from NeSI. For example, the grant funding the research
    programme has come to an end and the host institution does not wish
    to purchase computing resources from NeSI (or allocate computing
    resources from its subscription or collaborator share if it has
    one).
-   If the project's host institution has changed (or is about to
    change).
-   If the project's owner is no longer employed by or studying at the
    project's host institution, and there is no-one at the host
    institution who has agreed to take over project ownership
    responsibilities.
-   If the project's owner (or supervisor if the project has one) is not
    authorised to access NeSI facilities due to a refusal to accept or
    failure to abide by the NeSI Acceptable Use Policy.

## Who may request a project extension?

A request for a project extension should come from the project owner. If
the project owner is a student, we will include the supervisor on the
extension correspondence. The project supervisor may disallow an
extension request.

## How do I request an extension?

You can submit a request for an extension using <https://my.nesi.org.nz>
or by [opening a support
ticket](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/requests/new).

Please see [Requesting to renew an allocation via
my.nesi.org.nz](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/4600222769295)
for more details.

You will receive a series of automated emails inviting you to apply for
a new allocation (or, alternatively, clean up your project data) in the
following circumstances:

-   In the lead-up to the end of the [call
    window](https://www.nesi.org.nz/news/2018/04/new-application-process-merit-postgraduate-allocations)
    immediately before your currently active allocation is scheduled to
    end.
-   In the lead-up to the end of your allocation.
-   If your allocation ends before your project is scheduled to end, in
    the lead-up to the end of your project.

## Requests for new allocations

If you are requesting a new allocation of computing resources, we will
look at your usage history and come up with an estimated allocation size
and duration based on that history. If you think your rate of usage will
be substantially higher or lower than we estimate, you should let us
know what you think your rate of usage will be and why you expect it to
differ from our forecast.

Please be aware that:

-   First and subsequent allocations are subject to the NeSI allocation
    size and duration limits in force at the time they are considered by
    our reviewers.
-   An allocation from an institution's entitlement is subject to
    approval by that institution.

## Requests for project extensions without a new compute allocation

In some circumstances, you may wish to extend your project without
receiving a new allocation of compute units or node hours for the
project. Typically this occurs in cases like a PhD thesis under
examination when the project team would like to keep the research data
for a few months while waiting to find out whether more computational
work will be needed.

If this is your situation, please let us know when you request your
project extension. Please note that we are unlikely to let a project
continue without a compute allocation for more than six months at a
time. If you expect that your project will be suspended for more than
six months, we encourage you to enquire about our [Long-Term Storage
Service](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001169956) or
to move your research data off our facility and make arrangements with
your project's host institution for long-term data storage.
