## Environment Modules

Modules are a convenient  way to provide access to applications  on the
cluster. They prepare the environment you need to run an application.

For a full list of module commands run man module

|                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `module spider [ <string> ]` | List all modules whose names, including version strings, contain `<string>`. If the `<string>` argument is not supplied, list all available modules. (only on Mahuika)                                                |
| `module show <string>`       | Show the contents of the module given by `<string>`. If only the module name (e.g. `Python`) is given, show the default module of that name. If both name and version are given, show that particular version module. |
| `module load <string>`       | Load the module (name and version) given by `<string>`. If no version is given, load the default version.                                                                                                             |
| `module list [ <string> ]`   | List all currently loaded modules whose names, including version strings, contain `<string>`. If the `<string>` argument is not supplied, list all currently loaded modules.                                          |

## Slurm

Jobs on Mahuika and Māui are submitted* *in the form of a *batch
script *containing the code you want to run and a header of information
needed by our job scheduler *Slurm.*

## Creating a batch script

Create a new file and open it with nano myjob.sl

``` sl
#!/bin/bash -e
#SBATCH --job-name=SerialJob # job name (shows up in the queue)
#SBATCH --time=00:01:00      # Walltime (HH:MM:SS)
#SBATCH --mem=512MB          # Memory in MB
#SBATCH --qos=debug          # debug QOS for high priority job tests

pwd # Prints working directory
```

Copy in the above text and save and exit the text editor with 'ctrl +
x'.

Note:`#!/bin/bash`is expected by Slurm

Note: if you are a member of multiple accounts you should add the line
`#SBATCH --account=<projectcode>`

## Testing

We recommend testing your job using the debug Quality of Service (QOS). 
The debug QOS can be gained by adding the `sbatch` command line option
`--qos=debug`.  
This adds 5000 to the job priority so raises it above all non-debug
jobs, but is limited to one small job per user at a time: no more than
15 minutes and no more than 2 nodes.
!!! prerequisite Warning
     Please do not run your code on the login node.  Any processes running
     on the login node for long periods of time or using large numbers of
     CPUs will be terminated.

## Submitting

Jobs are submitted to the scheduler using:

``` sl
sbatch myjob.sl
```

You should receive an output

Submitted batch job 1748836

`sbatch`can take command line arguments similar to those used in the
shell script through SBATCH pragmas

You can find more details on its use on the [Slurm
Documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)

## Job Queue

The currently queued jobs can be checked using 

``` sl
squeue
```

You can filter to just your jobs by adding the flag

``` sl
squeue -u usr9999
```

You can also filter to just your jobs using

``` sl
squeue --me
```

You can find more details on its use on the [Slurm
Documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html)

You can check all jobs submitted by you in the past day using:

``` sl
sacct
```

Or since a specified date using:

``` sl
sacct -S YYYY-MM-DD
```

Each job will show as multiple lines, one line for the parent job and
then additional lines for each job step.
!!! prerequisite Tips
     sacct -X Only show parent processes.
     sacct --state=PENDING/RUNNING/FAILED/CANCELLED/TIMEOUT Filter jobs by
     state.

You can find more details on its use on the [Slurm
Documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html)

##  Cancelling

scancel &lt;jobid&gt; will cancel the job described by &lt;jobid&gt;.
You can obtain the job ID by using sacct or squeue.
!!! prerequisite Tips
     scancel -u \[username\] Kill all jobs submitted by you.
     scancel {\[n1\]..\[n2\]} Kill all jobs with an id between \[n1\] and
     \[n2\]

You can find more details on its use on the [Slurm
Documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/scancel.html)

## Job Output

When the job completes, or in some cases earlier, two files will be
added to the directory in which you were working when you submitted the
job:

`slurm-[jobid].out` containing standard output.

`slurm-[jobid].err` containing standard error.
