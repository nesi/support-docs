> ### Requirements
>
> -   Have an [active account and
>     project.](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/sections/360000196195-Accounts-Projects)
> -   Have a [SSH connection to a NeSI
>     cluster](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001016335),
>     and [set up as
>     recommended.](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/sections/360000189696)

# Standard Terminal

In a local terminal the following commands can be used to:

Move a file from your local machine to Mahuika.

    scp <path/filename> mahuika:<path/filename>

Move a file from Mahuika to your local machine.

    scp mahuika:<path/filename> <path/filename>

> ### Note
>
> -   This will only work if you have set up aliases as described in
>     [Terminal
>     Setup](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000625535-Terminal-Setup-MacOS-Linux-).
> -   As the terms 'maui' and 'mahuika' are defined locally, the above
>     commands *only works when using a local terminal* (i.e. not on
>     Mahuika).
> -   If you are using Windows subsystem, the root paths are different
>     as shown by Windows. e.g. `C:` is located at `/mnt/c/`

`scp` stands for Secure CoPy and operates in a similar way to regular cp
with the source file as the left term and destination on the right.

These commands make use of *multiplexing, *this means that if you
already have a connection to the cluster you will not be prompted for
your password.

## File Managers 

Most file managers can be used to connect to a remote directory simply
by typing in the address bar (provided your have an active connection to
the cluster and your ssh config file is set up as described
[here](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000625535)).

For Nautilus (Ubuntu default) just prepend the path you want to connect
to with `sftp://mahuika`. (<span class="kbd">ctrl</span> + <span
class="kbd">L</span> opens address bar)

This does not work for File Explorer (Windows default)

This does not work for Finder (Mac default)

If your default file manager does not support mounting over sftp, see
our documentation
on [SSHFS](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000621135).

# MobaXterm

Clicking the "*Scp*" tab (located on the left-hand side of the MobaXTerm
window) opens up a graphical user interface that can be used for basic
file operations. You can drag and drop files in the file explorer or use
the up and down arrows on the toolbar to upload and download files.

![2019-01-07\_SCP\_in\_MobaXTerm.png](../../includes/images/2019-01-07_SCP_in_MobaXTerm.png)

You may also transfer files as described under 'Standard Terminal'
(provided
[WSL](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001075575) is
enabled).

# WinSCP

As WinSCP uses multiple tunnels for file transfer you will be required
to authenticate again on your first file operation of the session. The
second prompt for your 2FA can be skipped, just the same as with login
authentication.

# Globus

Globus is available for those with large amounts of data, security
concerns, or connection consistency issues.  
You can find more details on its use on our [Globus support
page](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/4405623380751-Data-Transfer-using-Globus-V5).

# Rclone

Rclone is available for those that need to transfer data from cloud
storage services like Google drive or OneDrive.

The basic command syntax of Rclone:

    rclone subcommand options source:path dest:path

The most frequently used Rclone subcommands:

-   **rclone copy** – Copy files from the source to the destination,
    skipping what has already been copied.
-   **rclone sync** – Make the source and destination identical,
    modifying only the destination.
-   **rclone mov**e – Move files from the source to the destination.
-   **rclone delete** – Remove the contents of a path.
-   **rclone mkdir** – Create the path if it does not already exist.
-   **rclone rmdir** – Remove the path.
-   **rclone check** – Check if the files in the source and destination
    match.
-   **rclone ls** – List all objects in the path, including size and
    path.
-   **rclone lsd** – List all directories/containers/buckets in the
    path.
-   **rclone lsl** – List all objects in the path, including size,
    modification time and path.
-   **rclone lsf** – List the objects using the virtual directory
    structure based on the object names.
-   **rclone cat** – Concatenate files and send them to stdout.
-   **rclone copyto** – Copy files from the source to the destination,
    skipping what has already been copied.
-   **rclone moveto** – Move the file or directory from the source to
    the destination.
-   **rclone copyurl** – Copy the URL's content to the destination
    without saving it in the tmp storage.

A more extensive list can be found on the the [Rclone

# Rsync

Rsync is an utility that provides fast incremental file transfer and
efficient file synchronization between a computer and a storage disk.  
The basic command syntax of:  

    rsync -options source target

If the data source or target location is a remote site, it is defined
with syntax:  

    userame@server:/path/in/server

The most frequently used Rsync options:

-   **-r**                         Recurse into directories
-   **-a **                       Use archive mode: copy files and
    directories recursively and preserve access permissions and time
    stamps.
-   **-v**                        Verbose mode.
-   **-z**                        Compress
-   **-e ssh**                 Specify the remote shell to use.
-   **-n**                       Show what files would be transferred.
-   **--partial**             Keep partially transferred files.
-   **--progress**         Show progress during transfer.

A more extensive list can be found on the the [Rsync
documentation](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1).
