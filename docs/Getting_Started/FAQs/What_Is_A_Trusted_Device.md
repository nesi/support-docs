A trusted device is a piece of hardware (like a phone, computer, or tablet)
that a user has authorised to access their accounts or an organisation's resources,
typically after a verification process such as the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Do not trust shared laptops or public computers. Additionally, if you're using a private or incognito window in your browser,
keep in mind that it's temporary and should **not** be considered a secure or permanent environment: then do not trust it.

## When should I trust a device?

You should trust a device when it meets several criteria, including:

- strong security measures,
- an updated operating system,
- effective antivirus,
- proven ownership being recognised by the service provider, and
- being physically secured to prevent unauthorised access.

## What are the benefits to have a trusted device?

Using a trusted device will simplify your login process. For example, if a device is not trusted, additional authentication credentials need to be used at every login. However, if you login using a trusted device, you will not have to use your additional authentication credentials for 7 days on the same device.

## What name shall I give to my trusted device?

You should name your trusted device something that helps you identify it and differentiates it from your other devices. Each name should be unique (e.g. the process will fail if a name is used more than once).
Good names are descriptive but also personal, such as "My Personal Laptop" or "Sarah's iPhone."
Avoid names such as "My Favorite Device", as that could make it harder to manage if you have multiple trusted devices for the same account.

## How can I manage my trusted devices?

The list of all your trusted devices is available in [my.nesi.org.nz](https://my.nesi.org.nz) under Account -> [My Preferences](https://my.nesi.org.nz/account/preference) where you can delete any or all trusted devices as needed.

It is important to regularly review your list of trusted devices and remove any that are no longer in use. Old or obsolete devices—such as a laptop you no longer own or a device that has been replaced—may still appear as trusted and could pose a security risk. Removing these ensures that only your current, secure, and actively used devices can access your account without additional verification. Keeping your trusted devices list up to date helps protect your account from unauthorised access and maintains good security hygiene.
