description: Instructions for viewing images generated on the cluster
---

If for any reason downloading images is impractical you can view them on
the cluster using the `display` command. For example,

```sh
gm display myImage.png
```

This requires a [working X-11
server](../Accessing_the_HPCs/X11.md).
