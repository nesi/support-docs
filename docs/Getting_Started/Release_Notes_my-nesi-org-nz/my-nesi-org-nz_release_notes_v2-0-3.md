## Release Update - 10. June 2021

## New and Improved

-   Improved the "Reset NeSI HPC Account Password" form to clear values
    after submission.
-   Lowered the time until a user can reset the password and adjusted
    the feedback message to be more meaningful for users, if the change
    was not successful .

## Fixes

Fixed: details in password and 2FA reset email message (IP address,
device) are displayed again.
