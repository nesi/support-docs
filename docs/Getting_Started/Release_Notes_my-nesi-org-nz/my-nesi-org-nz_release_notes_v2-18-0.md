## Release Update - 07 November 2023

## New and Improved

-   A link to [NeSI's privacy
    policy](https://www.nesi.org.nz/about-us/security-privacy/privacy-policy)
    has been added to the bottom of all pages of my.nesi environment
-   We've shifted from using Tuakiri's RapidConnect service to Tuakiri's
    OpenID Connect bridge to improve overall security of my.nesi's user
    authentication process.
-   We've updated the display features of the table showing Merit grants
    available to researchers in order to improve our ability to make
    changes and future updates to the table's information.

## Fixes

-   Fixed a crash that used to occur when a user wanted to join a
    project on my.nesi and delete an entry within that project.
-   Fixed a security vulnerability in the my.nesi environment related to
    the libwebp library, a code library used to render and display
    images in the *WebP* format. 
-   Updated the allocation request form's end date message, restricting
    allocation requests to no further than one year in the future.
-   Changed which system components from NeSI's System Status page
    *(<https://status.nesi.org.nz/>)* are default notifications emailed
    to users. Users can customise their system status email
    notifications at any time. [Read more about that
    here](../../General/Announcements/Status_page_subscription_notification_changes.md).
