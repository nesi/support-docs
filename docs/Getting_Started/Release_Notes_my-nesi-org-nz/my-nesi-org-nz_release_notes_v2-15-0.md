## Release Update - 3. May 2023

## New and Improved

-   New Allocation Request page has been improved to add field
    validations

-   Links to information about notifications have been added under
    Account &gt; My Profile, when the Account Profile is edited

-   If my.nesi.org.nz portal cannot connect to NeSI server, a
    descriptive error message will be displayed

Â 

## Fixes

-   New allocation request start date rules updated when the project
    does not have a current allocation, today date will be used as the
    default value
-   New allocation request interval between the start date and end date
    should be around one year but with the quarter splits, it has been
    increased to 15 months
-   Inactive users won't receive email notifications when a new
    allocation request is created
-   Double clicks have been displayed on submit buttons to avoid
    duplicate items being created
