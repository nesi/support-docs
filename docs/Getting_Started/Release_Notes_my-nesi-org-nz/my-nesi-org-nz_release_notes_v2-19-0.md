## Release Update - 23 November 2023

## New and Improved

-   Minor text changes to the About NeSI, Project Application, and Login
    pages:
    -   updated the descriptions of NeSI services 
    -   simplified the overview of the project application process
    -   updated the list of organisations supported by Tuakiri 
-   Improved visibility of [Nearline (long-term
    storage)](../../Storage/Nearline_long_term_storage/Nearline_Long_Term_Storage_Service.md)
    allocations if any exist for your project(s). A project with only
    Nearline resources will have a status of Archived.
-   Notification banner created to display holiday hours for NeSI
    Support from the 22nd of December 2023 to the 2nd of January 2024.

## Fixes

-   If a project didn't have a previous allocation, the submission of a
    New Allocation Request would return an error internally. This has
    now been fixed. 

If you have any questions about any of the improvements or fixes,
please [contact NeSI Support](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz).
