## Release Update - 7. July 2022

## New and Improved

-   Added a banner to make users aware in case there is already a
    current allocation request for the project before raising another
    one
-   Added details to make users aware of their HPC account status when
    attempting to reset the MFA/2FA token

## Fixes
