If you are new to NeSI, short introductory lectures are available on
YouTube
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvbRzoDQPkuFsIzAWaIiYgs-kConq-Hjw)
to help get you started on the systems. These videos are open to anyone
interested in learning more about High Performance Computing (HPC) using
NeSI, prior to [getting a NeSI
account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/applyforaccess).

The recordings present an overview of NeSI systems and the HPC
platforms' capabilities, available software and environment modules,
best practice procedures, common commands for submitting jobs, and
optimising your work on the system.

Slides used in the lectures can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TCaJnpZO-s-s4NQ1P0a89flewT7HXmn2PHrW-3EPYg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Other ways to get 'Introductory' help

In addition to the material mentioned above, you can also seek help at
our weekly "Office Hours" or by attending a Workshop. Office hours are
drop-in sessions hosted by the NeSI Support Team where any and all
questions are welcome. **Our Office Hours schedule** can be found
[here](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/4830713922063).

NeSI also participates in and organises
[Workshops](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/training) covering a range
of topics. Many of these workshops - and particularly "Introduction to
HPC using NeSI", are designed for new users.

Finally, If you wish to schedule a live zoom introductory session
covering introductory material (perhaps useful for research groups),
please [contact
Support](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new "https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new")
and we can advise you on our availability.
