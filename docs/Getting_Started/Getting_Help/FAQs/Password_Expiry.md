NeSI passwords expire after two years. Â The prompt you will see when
that happens is

```sl
Password expired. Change your password now.
First Factor (Current Password): 
Second Factor (optional): 
Login Password: 
```

however passwords can not be reset this way, instead you should [reset
your password via the My NeSI
Portal](../../Getting_Started/Accessing_the_HPCs/Setting_Up_and_Resetting_Your_Password.md).
