Have questions about NeSI services<br>
Looking for tips on how to optimise your HPC jobs?<br>
Or, simply want to meet some of the team behind NeSI Support?<br>

We run regular online Office Hours sessions, hosted via Zoom. These
sessions are open to anyone, you don't need to be an existing NeSI
user.

## Office Hours in April 2024

Click on the links below to add the date & Zoom link to your calendar:

If you are unable to add an Office Hour session to your calendar through
these links, please email us at [training@nesi.org.nz](mailto:training@nesi.org.nz) and we can send a
calendar invite directly to you.

## How Does It Work

Each session follows a casual 'drop-in / drop-out' format, where you can
pop in at any point during the hour and stay for as long or as little as
you'd like.

Also, don't worry if you have a question or challenge that can't be
solved on the spot.  
We can always use the Office Hours to collect some basic information
about your issue and then reconnect with you at a later time to
troubleshoot things further.

## Other ways to get help

Remember, you can  {% include "partials/support_request.html" %} at any
time and we have a team of experts ready to answer any questions you may
have, big or small. You can also find helpful user resources, links and
documentation elsewhere in our User Support Centre.
