## Introduction

At NeSI we want to help you run your work as efficiently as possible on
our platforms, so that you obtain your results in a timely manner and so
that we can fit in as much work as possible, hopefully reducing queue
times for all users.

With this aim in mind, we may ask to perform a "job efficiency review"
of your work on NeSI, particularly if you have been granted, or are
requesting, a large compute allocation. See below for more details about
what to expect during this process. If you are interested in us looking
into your job efficiency for potential improvements, please contact us
at <support@nesi.org.nz>.

## Expected outcomes

At the end of a job efficiency review you could expect one of the
following outcomes:

-   We determine that your workflow/jobs are running efficiently on our
    platform
-   Some areas for improvement are identified (and agreed with you)
    -   For "quick wins" we may be able to achieve these improvements
        within the scope of the job efficiency review
    -   For larger pieces of work, we would assist you in applying for a
        [NeSI
        Consultancy](../../Getting_Started/Getting_Help/Consultancy.md)
        project, where we would work with you on a longer term project
        to implement any agreed changes

## What you can expect from us

During a job efficiency review you can expect that we will:

-   Spend some time (typically up to 10-20 hours) to investigate your
    software and workflows that you are running on NeSI, to determine
    whether there is an opportunity for optimisation or efficiency
    improvements
-   Communicate clearly and pass on any suggestions for improvements
    that we identify

## What we expect of you

During a job efficiency review, some input will be required from you,
such as:

-   Investing time to answer questions, provide code and input data as
    necessary and make changes to your workflow if needed (this may
    involve attending some Zoom meetings and/or email communication)
-   Setting up some test configurations that we can use for profiling
    and benchmarking your jobs; these should be representative of your
    work but don't necessarily need to be complete calculations. For
    example, with a simulation code we could choose to reduce the number
    of time steps but keep the domain size the same.
