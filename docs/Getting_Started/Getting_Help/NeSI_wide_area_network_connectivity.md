NeSI's national platform facilities are connected to the
[REANNZ](https://www.reannz.co.nz/) network, Aotearoa's high-performance
national digital network (or NREN). This national network supports
collaboration and contributions to data-intensive and complex science
and research initiatives in New Zealand and across the globe. 

## How to verify the status of external (wide area network - WAN) connectivity for NeSI

A real-time network status page is available on the REANNZ website as a
'weather map', which shows all traffic across its national network:

<https://weathermap.reannz.co.nz>

From that main 'weather map' view, you can drill down to a more detailed
view of specific addresses, e.g.:

**Wellington (WLG) for Niwa**

**Mayoral Drive, Auckland (MDR)**

<https://weathermap.reannz.co.nz/index.php?src=and15>

**UoA Tamaki Data Centre (TDC)**
