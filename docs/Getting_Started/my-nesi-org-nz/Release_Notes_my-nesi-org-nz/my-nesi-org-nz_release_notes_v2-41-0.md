## New and Improved
- Updated interface to explain NeSI's recent integration with REANNZ:
   - On 01 July 2025, New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) was integrated into the Crown company, Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand (REANNZ) Ltd. NeSI’s services and technologies are now hosted by REANNZ as a national [eResearch Infrastructure Platform](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/strategic-science-investment-fund/funded-infrastructure/eresearch-infrastructure-platform). Some of our tools (eg. my.nesi.org.nz) will retain a ‘NeSI’ brand as we transition our services and develop a longer-term strategy for this integrated platform. All NeSI services and support – including these Support Documentation pages and team monitoring the support@nesi.org.nz email – are continuing as you’ve known them. Also, the principles of our policies (Access, Acceptable Use, Security & Privacy, etc.) are carrying over and remain in effect. We'll be in touch if anything changes. If you have any questions about the NeSI-REANNZ integration, {% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.

## Fixed
- Improved sentence formatting by adding missing spaces before brackets.
- Freezer allocations are now correctly displayed when submitting requests to increase or extend storage allocations.
- Enhanced default dashboard logic to better integrate with our new identity management system. 

If you have any questions about any of the updates, please
{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
