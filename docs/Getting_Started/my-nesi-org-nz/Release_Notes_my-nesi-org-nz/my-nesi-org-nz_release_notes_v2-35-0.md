## New and Improved

- Freezer Resource Visibility: You can now see freezer resources with their defined names, providing clearer and more intuitive navigation.  

- Default Freezer Naming: Default freezer names now automatically follow the format <project code>-<compound allocation id>, making it easier to identify and manage your resources.  

- Credentials Page Update: We've revamped the Credentials pages to include the new HPC platform, enhancing your experience and making it easier to manage your credentials. The NeSI Credentials menu now combines the previous NeSI Password and NeSI 2FA Token menus into one streamlined interface.  

If you have any questions about any of the updates, please
