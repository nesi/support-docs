## Fixed
- Validation for long-term storage name: if the freezer storage name is defined with three characters or fewer, the field is now highlighted in red to alert users that the name is too short.
- Updated Globus documentation links: all Globus-related documentation links have been reviewed and updated to ensure they point to the latest resources.
- Project storage usage display: the storage usage is now available in the green tile on the project page.
