## New and Improved

- Previously, if your project's research grant was not included in the
 pre-populated list of awards, choosing "Other" from the list only
 enabled you to provide one alternative answer. Now, you have the
 ability to enter multiple grants when choosing "Other".

If you have any questions about any of the improvements or fixes,
pleaseÂ [contact NeSI Support](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz).
