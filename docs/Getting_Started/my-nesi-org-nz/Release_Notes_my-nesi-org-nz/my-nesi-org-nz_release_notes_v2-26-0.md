## New and Improved

- When a new allocation is requested, we are now able to extrapolate Mahuika compute units from previous allocations to help estimate future usage. 

## Fixes

- It is now possible to reliably log in from an incognito browser. 


If you have any questions about any of the updates or fixes, please
{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
