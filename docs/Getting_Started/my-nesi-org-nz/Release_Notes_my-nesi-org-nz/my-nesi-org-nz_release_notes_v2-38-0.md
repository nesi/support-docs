## New and Improved
- Enhanced project insights: Researcher project pages now display usage from the new 2025 HPC and storage platforms, giving you better visibility into your resource consumption.
- Improved visibility of request progress: When submitting allocation requests, you'll now see a spinning wheel to indicate that your request is being processed.  
- Stronger security: We've updated all packages to eliminate high-severity vulnerabilities and removed all unused packages to minimise risk and maintain a clean, secure environment.  

If you have any questions about any of the updates, please
{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
