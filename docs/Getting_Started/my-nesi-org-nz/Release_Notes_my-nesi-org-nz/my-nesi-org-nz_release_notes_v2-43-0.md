    - The quantity and usage columns have been swapped for better clarity.
        - Quantity shows the allocated quota.

- REANNZ Branding Updates 
    - The application now features a new REANNZ favicon.
    - Additional rebranding updates include renaming NeSI references to REANNZ throughout the application.
    - The newsletter section has been refreshed. The latest REANNZ edition from September can be found at https://www.reannz.co.nz/news-and-events/news-from-reannz-september.
    - The terms and conditions section has been updated to align with REANNZ branding and policies. Please review the updated terms to ensure compliance.

## Fixed
