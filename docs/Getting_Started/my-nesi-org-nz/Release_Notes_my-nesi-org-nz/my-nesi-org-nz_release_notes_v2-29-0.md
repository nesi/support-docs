## New and Improved

- When accessing the allocation request form, you will now have to either select if the request is for a new allocation with compute and storage or if the request is for updating the storage in the current allocation if it applies.  
- The allocation form is now listing all storage types available at NeSI (not just project persistent storage as previously). 
  - Persistent project disk space.  
  - Temporary project disk space (new).  
  - Long-term storage space (new).  
- The role of primary adviser has been removed from the list of possible roles that owners can assign new members of their projects, please select amongst: contact person, grant PI, owner, supervisor and team member.  

If you have any questions about any of the updates, please
