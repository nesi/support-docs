## Fixed
- When renewing your NeSI two-factor authentication (2FA) token, a QR code is displayed to allow you to take a picture and access an authentication code. At any time, you can manage your 2FA tokens at https://my.nesi.org.nz/account/manage-mfa.  
- Previously, when an error occurred during login, some users were being redirected to a null page. We have fixed this path so that you are now redirected to your account page.  

If you have any questions about any of the updates or fixes, please
