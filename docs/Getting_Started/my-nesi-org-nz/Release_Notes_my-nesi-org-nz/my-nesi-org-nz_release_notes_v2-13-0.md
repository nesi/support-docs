## Release Update - 28. November 2022

## New and Improved

-   When adding a new allocation request, new option to add the related
    grants funding the project if missing.

-   If a project has no compute allocation linked to it, a banner has
    been added to make users aware of the missing allocation request and
    the visual indicators have been made clearer.

-   Added links for the access policy and the acceptable use policy in
    the footer.

 

## Fixes

-   When adding a new allocation request, if an existing allocation
    request is present, an alert message is visible: a cross has been
    added to allow for the warning message to be closed.
