## New and Improved
- A spinning wheel indicator now appears when submitting account profile updates, providing clear feedback that your changes are being processed.

## Fixed
- All links to documents on https://docs.nesi.org.nz have been updated to point to the refactored support pages, ensuring easy access to the latest resources.
- The banner reminding project owners to review project members is visible again after being inadvertently hidden during the last framework update.
- The Project Team Experience summary section no longer appears twice in Apply for Access.

If you have any questions about any of the updates, please
{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
