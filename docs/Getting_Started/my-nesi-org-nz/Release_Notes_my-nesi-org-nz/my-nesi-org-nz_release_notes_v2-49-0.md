## New and Improved
- You can now view your Research Developer Cloud (RDC) projects directly in my.nesi.
- Compute allocation request prediction dates now reflect only your current compute allocations, resulting in more accurate estimates.

If you have any questions about any of the updates, please
{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
