## New and Improved
- Manage trusted devices more easily: Researchers can now review and manage their trusted devices directly from my.nesi under Account → My Preferences. Learn more: https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/FAQs/What_Is_A_Trusted_Device/.
- Improved workflow for adding project co‑owners and supervisors: When you add a new co‑owner or supervisor, they will now be automatically added as a team member, and a support ticket will be raised for assessment.
- Updated default values for Freezer allocation requests:
    - When included as part of a compute allocation request: 0 TiB
    - When requested on its own: 10 TiB
- Clearer guidance when no active allocation is present: Projects must have an active allocation in order to make a request for resources. If your project does not have an active allocation, the system will prompt you to request one by following these instructions: https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/my-nesi-org-nz/Requesting_to_renew_an_allocation_via_my-nesi-org-nz/#types-of-resource-requests

## Fixed
- Warnings for Closed or Suspended profiles: You can now add a researcher with a Closed or Suspended profile to your project, but a warning will be displayed to ensure you’re aware of the profile status.
- Terminology updates to remove HPC3, which was our temporary name for our new HPC Platform.
