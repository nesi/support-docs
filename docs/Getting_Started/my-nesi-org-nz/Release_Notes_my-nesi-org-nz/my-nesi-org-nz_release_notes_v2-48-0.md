## New and Improved
- Manage trusted devices more easily: Researchers can now review and manage their trusted devices directly from my.nesi under Account → My Preferences. Learn more: https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/FAQs/What_Is_A_Trusted_Device/.
- Improved workflow for adding project co‑owners and supervisors: When you add a new co‑owner or supervisor, the researcher will now be automatically added as a team member, and a support ticket will be raised for assessment.
- Updated default values for Freezer allocation requests:
    - When included as part of a compute allocation request: 0 TiB.
    - When requested on its own: 10 TiB.
- Clearer guidance when no active allocation is present: If your project does not have an active allocation, the system now provides clearer messaging outlining next steps.

## Fixed
- Warnings for Closed or Suspended profiles: You can now add a researcher with a Closed or Suspended profile to your project, but a warning will be displayed to ensure you’re aware of the profile status.
- Terminology updates to remove HPC3.
