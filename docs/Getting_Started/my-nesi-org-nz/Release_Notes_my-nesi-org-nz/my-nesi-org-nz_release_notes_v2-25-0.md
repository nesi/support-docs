## Fixes

- In certain validation corner cases, the submit button of the compound allocation request was disappearing. We've fixed this error so the button remains visible on the request form.  
- For new project requests, the default nobackup (temporary) storage value has been updated to 10,240 GB.  

If you have any questions about any of the  fixes, please
{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
