## Fixes

- In certain validation corner cases, the submit button of the allocation request was disappearing. We've fixed this error so the button remains visible on the request form.  
- Previously, new project requests showed a default nobackup (temporary) storage value of 1,240 GB. This has been updated to the correct default value of 10,240 GB.  

If you have any questions about any of the  fixes, please
{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
