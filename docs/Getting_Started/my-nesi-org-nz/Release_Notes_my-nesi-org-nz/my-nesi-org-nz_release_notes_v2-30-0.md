## New and Improved

- In the project details view, the NeSI OnDemand resources (NeSI OnDemand compute, NFS storage options) and the Freezer storage resources are now visible.

- The long-term storage space unit is now in TB (instead of GB) in the new allocation request page.  
- A new field, the long-tern storage name, is added to the new allocation request page. This allows to set the name of the particular storage in Freezer if needed (a default value is always available).  
- Preparation in supporting the long-term storage name in the project request as well as a new type of allocation request: the storage only allocation.  

If you have any questions about any of the updates, please
