## New and Improved

- To join an existing project, you can now ask the owner of the project to add you. Previously, this task required you to contact NeSI Support. The new steps to follow are outlined in the documentation pages linked below:
    - https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Accounts-Projects_and_Allocations/Applying_to_join_an_existing_NeSI_project/
    - https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Accounts-Projects_and_Allocations/Adding_members_to_your_NeSI_project/

- You will receive a warning email if your persistent storage is coming close to (95%) or is at capacity (100% >)

## Fixes

- In the allocation renewal form, the question "Is the project funded by a grant/contract?" is now mandatory to answer

- We have reinstated the alert informing users when a project does not have a current resource allocation

If you have any questions about any of the updates or fixes, please
