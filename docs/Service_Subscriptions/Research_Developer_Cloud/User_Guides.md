Our Research Developer Cloud enables easier and more adaptable collaboration around research data.

Research teams can use this platform to develop novel solutions that enable research through:

- *Cloud-native services:* Using cloud infrastructure and on-demand services to develop and manage custom, interactive solutions.
- *Programmable infrastructure:* Applying DevOps practices enabled by Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate, measure, collaborate, and learn.
- *Partnership-led approaches:* Collaborating with our DevOps specialists to build a platform or tools that can benefit your research community.

## Features

Our platform's cloud building blocks include:

- *Compute:* Virtual machines optimised for high-performance computational needs. Multiple flavours of CPU and GPU resources to support a range of compute and memory requirements.
- *Images:* Tailored operating systems to meet your research computing and data needs. Ready-to-use options available, as well as capability to create custom images and contribute to a pool of community-developed images.
- *Storage:* Scalable storage space that can be dynamically mounted to your Compute instances. Options to encrypt storage volumes for added security.
- *Networks:* Fast, reliable, and secure connectivity built on the REANNZ national network. Options for network customisation and security groups.
- *Identity:* Identity management services to create application credentials and control access to your projects.
- *Application Programming Interface (API):* All services are programmable via a public API to enable repeatable definition of infrastructure through software code.
