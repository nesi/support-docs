Using Globus to transfer and share files from/to a personal computer

## Install Globus Connect Personal on your workstation/laptop

See the [Globus howto page](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/) on how to
install a personal Globus endpoint on your computer (OS-specific
instructions).

Once your personal endpoint is created and you have activated it, check
Globus's [Endpoints administered by
you](https://app.globus.org/endpoints?scope=administered-by-me) to see
whether your endpoint shows up as active.

## Personal Endpoint file-transfer and sharing

If you need to share files from your personal computer or move files
between two personal computers, you need to be part of a subscription
with [Globus Plus](https://www.globus.org/subscriptions) enabled.

Globus Plus is a part of NeSI's Globus subscription. To join Globus
Plus, you must become a member of the Globus sponsor group *New Zealand
eScience Infrastructure*.

Check if your account already has this membership by viewing the [Globus
Plus](https://app.globus.org/account/plus) tab under your Account:

If you do not see an entry for *New Zealand eScience Infrastructure* on
this page, then:

1.  Click the "Add Globus Plus Sponsor" link.
2.  Select "New Zealand eScience Infrastructure" from the list of
    potential sponsors.
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions.

Once you have completed the process, your request to join the group will
be sent to us for approval. You'll get confirmation when your
application has been accepted. If you haven't received a confirmation
within five business days after you asked to add NeSI as a sponsor,
please [contact our support
team](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/requests/new).
