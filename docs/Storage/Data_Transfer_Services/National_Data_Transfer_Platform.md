description: "The National Data Transfer Platform uses Globus, a third-party service
for transferring large amounts of data between Globus Data Transfer
Nodes (DTNs). New Zealand DTNs facilitate the transfer of data to and
from institutional storage. This service allows data to be accessible to
any person who has a Globus account."
