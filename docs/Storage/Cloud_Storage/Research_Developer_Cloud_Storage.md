The Research Developer Cloud offers you also alternative types of storage.

- Object Storage within FlexiHPC (refers as "flash") is a file system storage that is primarily used for storing static data. Unlike other storage systems, object storage is independent of virtual machines and operating system type.

- Volumes as part of a Virtual Machine (refers as "spinning disk") are block storage devices that you attach to instances to enable persistent storage. You can attach a volume to a running instance or detach a volume and attach it to another instance at any time. You can also create a snapshot from or delete a volume.

Please visit [the Research Developer Cloud user guides](https://support.cloud.nesi.org.nz/user-guides/) to know
more about how to use the system.
