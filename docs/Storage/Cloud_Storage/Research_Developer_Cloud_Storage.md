Our Research Developer Cloud offers two types of storage:

- Object Storage within our Flexible HPC platform (referred to as "flash"): This is a storage filesystem that is primarily used for storing static data. Unlike other storage systems, Object Storage is independent of Virtual Machines and operating system type.

- Volumes as part of a Virtual Machine (referred to as "spinning disk"): These are block storage devices that you attach to instances to enable persistent storage. You can attach a volume to a running instance or detach a volume and attach it to another instance at any time. You can also create a snapshot from or delete a volume.

Please visit [the Research Developer Cloud user guides](https://support.cloud.nesi.org.nz/user-guides/) to know more about how to use the platform.

For information about pricing, details are available on the [Service Subscription page](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/NeSI_Service_Subscriptions/Overview/Pricing/#research-developer-cloud).
