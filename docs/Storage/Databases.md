Many research projects use reference or external databases.
This page describes databases that exist on Mahuika for use as well as recommendations for using some specific external databases.

## Maintained databases on Mahuika

Some databases are readable for all users on Mahuika.
These databases can be found at `/opt/nesi/db`.

## Requesting new or updated databases

If there is a database you think may be useful to many Mahuika users, or if you would like an updated version of one of the maintained databases, you can {% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.

## Recommendations for obtaining data from selected external databases

### JGI portals

Use Global endpoint

### NCBI
