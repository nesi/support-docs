*Released Thursday 15 April 2021.*

This is a minor release incorporating bug fixes and improvements.

-   The `nlcompare` command will no longer call attention to differences
    between files and directories that are solely due to the expected
    difference at the start of the absolute path, i.e. the textual
    difference between `/nesi/nearline/<project_code>` and
    `/nesi/project/<project_code>` (or `/nesi/nobackup/<project_code>`)
    at the start of the path is ignored as irrelevant. `nlcompare`
    continues to highlight the differences that might actually matter:
    files present on nearline but missing from the project or nobackup
    directory (or vice versa), files that have been renamed, and files
    with different sizes or last modified times.
-   The `nlget` command now gives a prompt and informative error message
    if you attempt to retrieve a single file from Nearline, instead of,
    as previously, submitting the job to the server, which would, after
    a wait that might well be lengthy depending on demand for the
    service, respond with `pol_failed`Â or some other uninformative
    error.
-   The `nlls` command now gives a prompt and meaningful error message
    if run on a single file with the `-s` command-line switch, instead
    of, as previously, returning no results.
-   The in-program usage message for the `nlpurge` command, which is
    printed when the wrong number or type of arguments is supplied, has
    been improved.
-   For ease of scripting, client or server errors that occur while the
    client program is running and you are requesting a nearline
    operation will, in almost all cases, cause the nearline client
    program to exit with a non-zero exit code. Note that this is not,
    and can not be, the case where the error first occurs after the job
    has been accepted by the server for processing.
