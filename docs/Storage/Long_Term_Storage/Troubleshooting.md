## Upload or Retrieval taking a long time
Uploading or retrieving data can sometimes take longer than expected. `tmux` is a terminal multiplexer, a multiplexer enables the creation and control of multiple terminals from a single screen.  It also allows the detachment of a screen to run in the background with the ability to re-attach and start where you left off.

An example of starting and using a `tmux` session:
``` sh
# create new tmux session called 'data_transfer'
tmux new -s freezer_transfer

# cd to directory containing files to upload
cd /nesi/nobackup/<project_id>/myproject

# put data 'your_folder' into Freezer bucket
s3cmd put --recursive --verbose your_folder s3://<freezer-bucket>/your_directory/your_folder
```
To detatch from the current `tmux` session by:
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd>, then <kbd>d</kbd>

Detatching the `tmux` session, allows you to close your primary terminal and logoff while the upload continues.Â 

To reattach to the session:

``` sh
tmux attach -t freezer_transfer
```

The tmux session(s) will remain until you terminate it, or the node is rebooted.
