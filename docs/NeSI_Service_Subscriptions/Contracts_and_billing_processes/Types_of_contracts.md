Typically our Subscription contracts are based on one-year terms and
invoiced on a quarterly basis\*.

-   *HPC Platform:  
    *This is an inclusive package that provides access to all NeSI
    services (compute, storage, support, consultancy, etc.) in one
    Subscription so that you have the flexibility at any point during
    the term of the contract to use any service. You are only charged
    for what you use.

-   *National Data Transfer Platform - Membership & managed endpoint:  
    *A National Data Transfer Platform is delivered through a
    partnership between NeSI, REANNZ, Globus, and research institutions
    across the country. [Read more
    here](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/data-services). As a managed
    endpoint, your institution can provide secure, reliable, and fast
    data transfer to/from NeSI’s HPC Platform as well as to/from other
    Globus endpoints across New Zealand and internationally. 

We are also happy to discuss other custom options for things like our
Training service.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss our subscription
terms or invoicing schedule in more detail, [get in
touch](mailto:info@nesi.org.nz).

 

*\*National Data Transfer Platform service agreements are invoiced upon
contract signing, as the fee is a one-time, annual, up-front fee.*
