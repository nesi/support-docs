Charges for Subscription usage are typically invoiced on a quarterly
basis.  
  
If your organisation requires a Purchase Order (PO) Number be used for
invoices, the PO Number must be provided to us upon signing your
Subscription service agreement.

If you have any questions about Subscription billing processes, don’t
hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:info@nesi.org.nz).
