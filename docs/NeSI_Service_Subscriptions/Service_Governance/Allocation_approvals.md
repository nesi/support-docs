Access to NeSI compute and storage resources is managed through
allocations. An allocation is a certain amount of a resource, or of a
rate at which a resource can be consumed, during a defined period of
time (in this case, the term of the Subscription).

Depending on the nature of your Subscription, you can choose to directly
manage allocation approvals for projects from your institution or leave
those decisions to the NeSI Support Team. See examples of some common
approval scenarios below.  
  

**Subscription used by a single project**  
If there is only one project associated with a Subscription, the
contract’s full resource entitlement can be allocated to that single
project (with the division of resources such as storage vs compute left
to the discretion of the project owner).

**Subscription used by multiple projects**  
If the Subscription contract covers multiple projects, the contract
entitlement is split between the projects. The Subscriber can decide how
it should be split, or NeSI’s Support Team can review the project
requests and make a recommendation based on project requirements.
