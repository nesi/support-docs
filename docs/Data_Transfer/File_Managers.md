# File Managers

!!! prerequisite
    Have SSH setup as described in [Standard Terminal Setup](../Getting_Started/Accessing_the_HPCs/Standard_Terminal_Setup.md)

## Windows and Mac

If your default file manager does not support mounting over SFTP, see
[Can I use SSHFS to mount the cluster filesystem on my local machine?](../Getting_Started/FAQs/Can_I_use_SSHFS_to_mount_the_cluster_filesystem_on_my_local_machine.md).

## Ubuntu

For Nautilus (Ubuntu default) just prepend the path you want to connect
to with `sftp://mahuika`. (ctrl + L opens address bar)
