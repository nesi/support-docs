## Advantages of Globus

Globus allows users to transfer data between systems. Some advantages of using Globus are that:

* It uses a web-based graphical user interface to help users navigate through file systems and transfer data.
* Globus will perform data transfers in the background, allowing you to shutdown your computer while the transfer continues (as long as you are not transferring data to your computer)
* If there are any disruptions to your transfer, Globus can resume from where it left off.

## Glossary

* Endpoints: Globus refers to computers, servers, high capacity storage systems as endpoints.
