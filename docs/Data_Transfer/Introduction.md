**Recommended Read**: [data transfer best practises](./Data_Transfer_Best_Practices.md) whenever you move data to and from Mahuika.

There are several ways to transfer your data between the Mahuika Supercomputer and your computer or server.

For simple, graphical user interface options, see:

* [Moving data with OnDemand](./OnDemand.md)
* [Navigating Mahuika using VSCode](./VSCode.md)
* [Setting up a File Manager on your computer](./File_Managers.md)

For file transfer methods that use the terminal, see:

* [scp (Secure Copy)](./scp.md)
* [rsync](./Rsync.md)
* [RClone](./RClone.md)

If you are transferring large files or a large amount of files, see:

* [FileSender](./FileSender.md)
* [Globus](./Globus/Overview.md)

For transferring data using specific tools, see:

* [File transferring using MobaXterm](./Data_Transfer_Using_MobaXterm.md)
* [File transferring using WinSCP](./Data_Transfer_Using_WinSCP.md)
