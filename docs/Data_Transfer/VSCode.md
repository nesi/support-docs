    [Setting up VScode](../Getting_Started/Accessing_the_HPCs/VSCode.md).

It is possible to use VSCode to navigate Mahuika, as well as to upload/download file to/from Mahuika.  Please **do not** use this method for transferring large files.  Please see our [Data Transfer Overview](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Data_Transfer/Data_Transfer_Overview/) page for options.

## Navigating through Mahuika on VSCode

Once you have login to Mahuika in VSCode, click `File` --> `Open`:

This will activate the top field box, where you can write the path you are wanting to access in mahuika. For example if I wanted to go to my scratch directory I would type `/nesi/nobackup/nesi99999`. Write the desired path in this top field and click the `OK` button twice next to the field:

You may be asked to indicate if you trust Mahuika. If asked, click the button indicating you trust the authors:

You now have access to your files on Mahuika:
