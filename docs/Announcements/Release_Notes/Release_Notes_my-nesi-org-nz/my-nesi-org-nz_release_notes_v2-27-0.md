## New and Improved

- If users create a project request and add grants, they will be prompted by an updated dialogue box to enter the grant details.  
- We have upgraded many of the software components that power the my.nesi.org.nz framework (node.js 20.16, Angular 17 and all necessary packages), which will improve overall performance and functionality of the site.  
- We have updated one of our authentication tools, Keycloak, to version 22.  

If you have any questions about any of the updates or fixes, please
