## New and Improved

- User notification preferences are now available under their own menu
    item called "My Preferences" under Accounts (Accounts &gt; My
    Preferences). Previously, notification preferences were only
    available to view through the "My Profile" or "My HPC Account" menu
    items under Accounts.
- On the Project page and New Allocation Request page, tool tip text
    referring to
    [nn\_corehour\_usage](../../../Scientific_Computing/Running_Jobs_on_Maui_and_Mahuika/Checking_your_projects_usage_using_nn_corehour_usage.md)
    will appear when you hover over the Mahuika Compute Units
    information.

## Fixes

- When a New Allocation request form is started, if a project was
    previously inactive, the default start date proposed will be the
    current date.

- The 'Request Account' button on our Register form is disabled until
    all mandatory fields are completed. If mandatory information is
    missing, an error message will appear to identify what's missing.

If you have any questions about any of the improvements or fixes, please
{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
