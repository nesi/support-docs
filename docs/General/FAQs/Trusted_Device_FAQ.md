## What is a Trusted Device?

A trusted device is a piece of hardware (like a phone, computer, or tablet) 
that a user has authorized to access their accounts or an organization's resources, 
typically after a verification process such as two-factor authentication.
Do not trust shared laptop or desktop for example. 

## When should I trust a device?

You should trust a device when it meets several criteria, 
including strong security measures, an updated operating system, effective antivirus, proven ownership
being recognized by the service provider, and being physically secured to prevent unauthorized access.

## What are the benefits to have a trusted device?

You do not have to use your 2FA for 7 days on the same device.
If the device is not trusted, 2FA needs to be used at every login.

## What name shall I give to my trusted device?

You should name your trusted device something that helps you identify it and 
differentiates it from your other devices. Each name should be unique (e.g. the process will fail if a name is used more than once). 
Good names are descriptive but also personal, 
such as "My Personal Laptop" or "Sarah's iPhone." 
You should not name it after a personal characteristic like "My Favorite Device" as 
this could make it harder to manage if you have multiple trusted devices for the same account.
