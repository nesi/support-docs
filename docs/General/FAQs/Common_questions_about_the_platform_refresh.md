description: Common questions researchers have about NeSI's platform refresh in 2024.
---

NeSI is evolving its technology platform to ensure Aotearoa's national eResearch infrastructure and services are more accessible, responsive, and flexible to your needs. 

Below are answers to some of the most common questions we're hearing from you:

## When is this happening?

New equipment is being delivered as we speak and we've begun installing components in Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland's Tamaki Data Centre. New services aren't expected online before July 2024. We'll keep you updated as our timelines are confirmed. If you are enthusiastic to be among the first groups to try the new platform, please be in touch.

## Will the software package I use be available on the new platforms?

All software currently supported on Mahuika's Milan nodes will be deployed. If you haven't tried these nodes yet, visit this guide for testing your code on Milan.

## Will a long system outage be required as part of the migration of data, users, and teams?

We're planning to run our migration in stages in order to avoid any lengthy outages and to maintain a smooth user experience. We'll be sharing more details on migration timing in the coming months.
