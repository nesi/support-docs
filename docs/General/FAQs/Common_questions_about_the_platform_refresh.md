description: Common questions researchers have about NeSI's platform refresh in 2024.
---

NeSI is evolving its technology platform to ensure Aotearoa's national eResearch infrastructure and services are more accessible, responsive, and flexible to your needs. 

Along the way, we'll use this page to share answers to some of the most common questions we're hearing from you.

## Which NeSI Services are impacted by this change?

All compute, storage, and data services will leverage the new infrastructure. We also expect our Consultancy and Training Service to realise benefits from the new platforms.

## What benefits do we get with the new platform?

We’re bringing on more capable and energy efficient CPUs, more powerful GPUs, enhanced storage capabilities, and new cloud-native development environments. This evolution in our platform enables NeSI to upgrade our existing services, grow our technology partnerships, and unlock a richer array of services beyond traditional HPC.

## When is this happening?

New equipment is being delivered as we speak and we've begun installing components in Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland's Tamaki Data Centre. New services aren't expected online before September 2024. We'll keep you updated as our timelines are confirmed. If you are enthusiastic to be among the first groups to try the new platform, please [get in touch](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz).

## Why is NeSI making this change?

We know that computational capabilities and eResearch services are critical to science globally and Aotearoa's prosperity. You’ve told us your needs are changing and in response we’ve been lifting our capabilities, exploring new modes of work, and supporting broader access to advanced tools. 

## Will the software package I use be available on the new platforms?

All software currently supported on Mahuika's Milan nodes will be deployed. If you haven't tried these nodes yet, [visit this guide for testing your code on Milan](https://github.com/nesi/support-docs/blob/platform-refresh-faq-draft/docs/General/FAQs/'General/Announcements/Preparing_your_code_for_use_on_NeSIs_new_HPC_platform').

## Will a long system outage be required as part of the migration of data and projects?

We're planning to run migration in stages in order to avoid any lengthy outages and to maintain a smooth user experience. We'll share information ongoing as we stage releases of various services and migrations of data and projects.

## Do I need to move my data or software?

Projects and data will be migrated in staggered phases as systems become available. You might be asked to check and confirm your migration has been successful, and that you are able to continue your work. If you currently do not use Mahuika's Milan nodes, we recommend you test your workloads on those nodes now.

## Do I need to create a user account?

All existing NeSI users will be migrated to the new systems. Your existing user account will work on the new systems though you will be required to reset your password and second factor.

## I'm currently running on Mahuika, will something change for me?

The platform NeSI has selected to replace Mahuika is similar to the recently commissioned Mahuika AMD Milan compute nodes. We're using these current Milan nodes to validate any issues. If you are already using the Milan nodes to support your work, no action is required from you at this point. If you are using Mahuika's Broadwell nodes or Maui, we recommend you [test your workloads on Milan](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/General/Announcements/Preparing_your_code_for_use_on_NeSIs_new_HPC_platform/) now.

## Does this affect Nearline? 

Yes, all NeSI compute and storage services will leverage the new infrastructure. Nearline is changing, leveraging different technology to deliver an easier to use cold storage solution. We'll share more details on this soon. No action is required from you at this stage. If you have workflows which touch Nearline we will update our docs as the replacement service comes online.

## I'm running on Māui, will there be any changes affecting me?

Some projects on Māui will move to the new NeSI infrastructure, so each Māui project has been given a small allocation on Mahuika which can be used by Māui users to validate the software they need is available (or can be built) on the AMD Milan nodes and works as expected. All members of the Māui project can use this Mahuika allocation. Visit this [how-to guide for instructions]('General/Announcements/Preparing_your_code_for_use_on_NeSIs_new_HPC_platform') of how to test your code in advance.

## I have more questions that aren't covered here. Where can I go or who can I talk to for more information?

Reach out anytime - no question is too small. We are ready to respond - email us at support@nesi.org.nz and we also invite you to join our [weekly Online Office Hours]('Getting_Started/Getting_Help/Weekly_Online_Office_Hours') to chat with us one-to-one.
