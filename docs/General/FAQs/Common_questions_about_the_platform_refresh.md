description: Common questions researchers have about NeSI's platform refresh in 2024.
---

NeSI is evolving its technology platform to ensure Aotearoa's national eResearch infrastructure and services are more accessible, responsive, and flexible to your needs. 

Along the way, we'll use this page to share answers to some of the most common questions we're hearing from you.

## When is this happening?

New equipment is being delivered as we speak and we've begun installing components in Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland's Tamaki Data Centre. New services aren't expected online before August 2024. We'll keep you updated as our timelines are confirmed. If you are enthusiastic to be among the first groups to try the new platform, please [get in touch](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz).

## Why is NeSI making this change?

We know that computational capabilities and eResearch services are critical to science globally and Aotearoa's prosperity. You’ve told us your needs are changing and in response we’ve been lifting our capabilities, exploring new modes of work, and supporting broader access to advanced tools. 

## Will the software package I use be available on the new platforms?

All software currently supported on Mahuika's Milan nodes will be deployed. If you haven't tried these nodes yet, visit this guide for testing your code on Milan.

## Will a long system outage be required as part of the migration of data, users, and teams?

We're planning to run our migration in stages in order to avoid any lengthy outages and to maintain a smooth user experience. We'll be sharing more details on migration timing in the coming months.

## Do I need to move my data or software?

No. Our current plan is for the NeSI team to migrate users, data, and teams in staggered phases once the systems are ready. No action from you will be required. If you currently do not use Mahuika's Milan nodes, please aim to test your software on those nodes now, so that we can identify any potential issues in advance. 

## Do I need to create a user account?

No. All existing NeSI users will be migrated in a staggered manner to the new systems. Your existing user account will work on the new systems.

## I'm currently running on Mahuika, will something change for me?

The platform NeSI has selected to replace Mahuika is similar to the recently commissioned Mahuika AMD Milan compute nodes. So, we'll be using these current nodes to validate any issues. If you are already using the Milan nodes to support your work, no action is required from you at this point. If you are using Mahuika's Broadwell nodes or Maui, please aim to [test your code on Milan](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/General/Announcements/Preparing_your_code_for_use_on_NeSIs_new_HPC_platform/) as soon as possible. If you encounter any errors or have any challenges when submitting your jobs on these nodes, let us know and we can work together to solve any issues.

## Does this affect the Nearline service? 

Yes, all NeSI compute and storage services will leverage the new infrastructure.

## I'm running on Maui, will there be any changes affecting me?

Some projects on Māui will move to the new NeSI infrastructure, so each Māui project has been given a small allocation on Mahuika which can be used by Māui users to validate the software they need is available (or can be built) on the AMD Milan nodes and works as expected. All members of the Māui project can use this Mahuika allocation. Visit this [how-to guide for instructions]('General/Announcements/Preparing_your_code_for_use_on_NeSIs_new_HPC_platform') of how to test your code in advance.

## What benefits do we get with the new platform?

We’re bringing on more efficient CPUs, more powerful GPUs, enhanced storage capabilities, and new cloud-native development environments. This evolution in our platform enables NeSI to upgrade our existing services, grow our technology partnerships, and unlock a richer array of services beyond traditional HPC.     

## Are any NeSI Services impacted by this change?

All NeSI compute, storage and data services will leverage the new infrastructure. We also expect our Consultancy and Training Service to realise benefits from the new platforms.

## I have more questions that aren't covered here. Where can I go or who can I talk to for more information?

Reach out to our Support Team - no question is too small. Our Support Team is ready to respond to emails sent to support@nesi.org.nz and we invite you to join our [weekly Online Office Hours]('Getting_Started/Getting_Help/Weekly_Online_Office_Hours') to chat with us one-to-one.
