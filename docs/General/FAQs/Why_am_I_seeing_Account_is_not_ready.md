If you don’t see the ‘Set Password’ button, it means your information on
our database is not ready yet, your user account has not yet been
created, or you are not a member of an active project. In this case,
please email
[support@nesi.org.nz](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz?subject=Please%20confirm%20my%20My%20NeSI%20account%20and%20add%20me%20to%20a%20project%20team)
and wait for a member of our support team to confirm your account and
group membership.
