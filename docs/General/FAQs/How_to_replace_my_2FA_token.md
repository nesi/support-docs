Currently there is no way to reset your 2FA through the NeSI portal.

Please [raise a ticket with support](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz?subject=Please%20reset%20my%202FA%20token.&body=I%20have%20lost%20my%202FA%20token.%20%0APlease%20can%20you%20reset%20it%2C%20my%20username%20is%20%3Cusername%3E) and we will reset it for you.
