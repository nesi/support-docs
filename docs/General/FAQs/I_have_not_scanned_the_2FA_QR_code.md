The QR code shown during the device registration cannot be regenerated
or displayed again.  
If you do not capture the QR code, or lose the device storing the code
(also called a token), you will be unable to access your account. 

To have your existing token deleted so another can be generated for your
account, log in to [my.nesi.org.nz](https://my.nesi.org.nz) and select
the option 'Manage Two-Factor token' under 'Account'.
