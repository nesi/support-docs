There are many different reasons why an application could crash. We
cannot list all the different possibilities, but we will help you to
investigate.

### OOM

One common reason is a limited amount of memory. Then the application
could crash with an [Out Of Memory exception](../../General/FAQs/What_does_oom_kill_mean.md).

### Stack size

On our XC system (MƒÅui) the stack size is limited. If you application
needs more resources on stack, if could result in strange unpredictable
crashes. You could get for example an \`array index out of bounds\`
error, not directly pointing to the source of the issue. You can try to
unlimit stack size using \`ulimit -s unlimited\` in your submission
script.

### Debugger

Another common issue is an error in the code. For example an application
could (may to unexpected input and missing error handling) call a
division by 0. Debugger can help to find the source of the issue. On the
NeSI systems are different debuggers available. For serial application
the [Gnu debugger
gdb](https://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/gdb/index.html) is
available. Furthermore, the [ARM DDT
debugger](https://developer.arm.com/docs/101136/latest/ddt/getting-started)
is available, which can handle, parallel, serial, applications, written
in C/C++, Fortran, and Python (limited support).
