[SSHFS](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) allows you to mount a remote
filesystem on your local machine. SSHFS relies on SSH underneath, so you
should follow the "Recommended logon procedure" instructions
[here](../../General/FAQs/Logging_in_to_the_HPCs.md) to configure SSH
first.

## Linux

Use the following commands to mount your home directory from Mahuika on
your local machine (the same command will work for MƒÅui, just replace
the names):

``` sl
# create a mount point and connect
mkdir -p ~/mahuika-home
sshfs -oauto_cache,follow_symlinks mahuika: ~/mahuika-home
```

Now you should be able to navigate to "~/mahuika-home" on your local
machine to access your home directory on Mahuika. To unmount the
directory run:

``` sl
fusermount -u ~/mahuika-home
```

To mount a project directory, you could run:

``` sl
# create a mount point and connect
mkdir -p ~/mahuika-project
sshfs -oauto_cache,follow_symlinks mahuika:/nesi/project/nesiXXXXX ~/mahuika-project
```

## MacOS

We recommend using some extra options with MacOS. The following commands
will mount your home directory, make it show up under devices in Finder
and give the volume a sensible name:

``` sl
# create a mount point and connect
mkdir -p ~/mahuika-home
sshfs mahuika: ~/mahuika-home \
    -oauto_cache,follow_symlinks \
    -ovolname=MahuikaHome,defer_permissions,noappledouble,local 
```

To unmount the directory on MacOS, either eject from Finder or run:

``` sl
umount ~/mahuika-home
```
!!! prerequisite Note
     Newer MacOS does not come with SSHFS pre installed. You will have to
     install FUSE as SSHFS from [here](https://osxfuse.github.io/).
