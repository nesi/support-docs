     [File permissions and
     groups](../../Storage/File_Systems_and_Quotas/File_permissions_and_groups.md)

If you move or copy a file or directory from one project directory to
another, or from somewhere within your home directory to somewhere
within a project directory, generally the file, or the directory
together with its contents, as the case may be, will keep its original
ownership, group and permissions.

So, supposing Joe Bloggs moves a file from his home directory to the
project directory `/nesi/project/nesi99999`, his fellow team members
won't be able to write to it:

```sh
$ ls -l README
-rw-r--r-- 1 bloggsj bloggsj 235 Mar 14  2014 README
$ mv README /nesi/project/nesi99999/bloggsj/README
$ ls -l /nesi/project/nesi99999/bloggsj/README
-rw-r--r-- 1 bloggsj bloggsj 235 Mar 14  2014 /nesi/project/nesi99999/bloggsj/README
```

As you can see, the file stays in the group `bloggsj`, that is Joe
Bloggs' personal group, even though it is now inside the project
directory.

There is, however, a solution involving the `rsync` command, a more
advanced version of `scp`. `rsync` is typically used to copy files
between two or more machines, but can also be used within the same
machine.

!!! warning
     In both these commands, the `--no-perms` and `--no-group` options must
     both come after `-a`. `-a` implicitly asserts `--perms` and `--group`,
     and will therefore override whichever
     of `--no-perms` and `--no-group` come before it.

## To copy a file (or directory and its contents), updating its group and setting its permissions

```sh
rsync -a --no-perms --no-group --chmod=ugo=rwX,Dg+s /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

## To move a file (or directory and its contents), updating its group and setting its permissions

!!! warning
     The `--remove-source-files` option is safe only if every source file
     is otherwise left intact during the moving process.

```sh
rsync --remove-source-files -a --no-perms --no-group --chmod=ugo=rwX,Dg+s /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

If you want to set files to executable in all cases,
replace `...ugo=rwX...` with `...ugo=rwx...`. The capital `X` means,
"Preserve whatever executable permissions existed on the source file and
aren't masked at the destination." A lower case `x` on the other hand
means, "Make this entity executable, even if it wasn't so previously,
though this may be masked at the destination."

## To fix the permissions of a file or directory that is already in its intended place

Change to the parent directory, which could be a project or nobackup
directory, that you want to fix, and find and fix your files. You can do
this by means of the following commands.

```sh
# Replace nesi12345 with your desired project code
group=nesi12345
startdir=$(pwd)
# Replace /nesi/project with /nesi/nobackup if needed
cd /nesi/project/${group}
# Move all files, directories, etc. owned by yourself into the project group
# The --no-dereference option updates the group of symbolic links (where permitted)
find . -user $(whoami) -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} chgrp --no-dereference ${group} {}
# Make all files owned by yourself readable and writable by the group
find . -user $(whoami) -and -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} chmod g+rw {}
# Make all directories owned by yourself readable, writable and executable by the group,
# and set the setgid bit
find . -user $(whoami) -and -type d -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} chmod g+rwxs {}
# Go back to the starting location
cd ${startdir}
```
