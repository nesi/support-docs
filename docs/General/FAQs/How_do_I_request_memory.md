In Slurm, there are two ways to request memory for your job:

-   `--mem`: Memory per node
-   `--mem-per-cpu`: Memory per [logical
    CPU](../../Scientific_Computing/Running_Jobs_on_Maui_and_Mahuika/Hyperthreading.md)

In most circumstances, you should request memory using `--mem`. The
exception is if you are running an MPI job that could be placed on more
than one node, with tasks divided up randomly, in which case
`--mem-per-cpu` is more appropriate. More detail is in the following
table, including how you can tell what sort of job you're submitting.

<sup>1</sup> If your job consists of only one task there's no reason to
request a specific number of nodes, and requesting more than one node
will cause you to be charged too much for your job. A one-task job will
be assigned one node by default.

<sup>2</sup> If you don't request a specific number of nodes, it makes
no sense to request a specific number of tasks per node.

<sup>3</sup> It's usually a good idea to request a little more memory
from Slurm than your program absolutely needs, to give your job a buffer
in case its behaviour varies slightly from run to run.

<sup>4</sup> If either `-n` or `--ntasks` is used along with
`--ntasks-per-node`, `--ntasks-per-node` will be silently ignored.

<sup>5</sup> An MPI job that is evenly split between two or more nodes
and that doesn't specify a total number of tasks will need either `-N`
(or `--nodes`) or `--ntasks-per-node`, or both, to be greater than 1;
and both must be positive integers.

<sup>6</sup> If you set `-N` (or `--nodes`) to 1, that is effectively
the same as setting`--ntasks-per-node` the same as`-n` (or `--ntasks`),
and the job is guaranteed to run on a single node. On the other hand, if
you request `-N` (or `--nodes`) to be the same as `-n` (or `--ntasks`),
that is effectively the same as setting `--ntasks-per-node=1`, and the
job will be evenly split between nodes. In either of these cases,
`--mem` is better than`--mem-per-cpu`. Meanwhile, requesting more nodes
than tasks never makes sense.
