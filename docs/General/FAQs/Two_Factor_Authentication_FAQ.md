## What is Multi-Factor Authentication?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a method of confirming a user's
identity by requiring the user to present two pieces of evidence
("factors") to an authentication mechanism. 

On our system, the 'first factor' is your institutional credentials, 
which you provide through the usual login page, while the second factor
is a six digit number generated by an authentication app on the user's mobile device.

## What do I need in order to obtain additional authentication credentials?

In order to obtain additional authentication credentials, you will need a
mobile device. On that mobile device, you will then need to install
Google Authenticator (or another QR code reader application that
implements the Time-based One Time Password algorithm) on your mobile
device.
See also [First_Time_Login](../../Getting_Started/Accessing_the_HPCs/First_Time_Login.md).

## Can I use an SSH key pair as alternative authentication credentials?

We do not currently support SSH authentication.

## How do I transfer my old authentication credentials onto my new device?

### Authy

It should get synchronised automatically.

### Google Authenticator

Open Authenticator on both devices. On the
original device tap the three-dot menu icon followed by **Transfer
accounts**, then **Export accounts**, select the accounts you want to
keep and then press **Next**. If these options are not present then
first update your Authenticator. On the new device press **Import
existing accounts** then scan the QR code provided on the old device.

## How do I get new authentication credentials?

See article [How to replace my authentication credentials](./How_to_replace_my_2FA.md).

## Can I use the same 6-digit code again?

No. You can only use each 6-digit code once and must
then wait for a new 6-digit code to cycle. Attempting to use the same
6-digit code will cause your Authentication to fail.
