## What is a Second Factor?

**Answer:** Two Factor Authentication is a method of confirming a user's
identity by requiring the user to present two pieces of evidence
("factors") to an authentication mechanism. In our system, the first
factor is a password (something the user knows), while the second factor
is a token generated by software on the user's mobile device (something
the user possesses).

## What do I need in order to obtain a second factor token?

**Answer:** In order to obtain a second factor token, you will need a
mobile device. On that mobile device, you will then need to install
Google Authenticator (or another QR code reader application that
implements the Time-based One Time Password algorithm) on your mobile
device. See also [Setting Up Two-Factor
Authentication](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/articles/360000203075).

## Can I use an SSH key pair as an alternative second factor?

**Answer:** We do not support SSH keys as a second factor and we have no
plans to implement SSH key-based authentication. Only time-based codes
are currently valid.

## I have a new mobile device. How do I transfer my old second factor onto my new device?<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">* *</span>

**Authy:** It should get synchronised automatically.

**Google Authenticator:** Open Authenticator on both devices. On the
original device tap the three-dot menu icon followed by **Transfer
accounts**, then **Export accounts**, select the accounts you want to
keep and then press **Next**. If these options are not present then
first update your Authenticator. On the new device press **Import
existing accounts** then scan the QR code provided on the old device. 

## How do I get a new Second Factor?<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"> </span>

**Answer:** See article
[here](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000684635-How-to-replace-my-2FA-token).

## Can I use the same Second Factor again?

**Answer:** No. You can only use each Second Factor code once and must
then wait for a new Second Factor to cycle. Attempting to use the same
Second Factor will cause your Authentication to fail.
