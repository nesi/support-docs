A trusted device is a piece of hardware (like a phone, computer, or tablet) 
that a user has authorised to access their accounts or an organisation's resources, 
typically after a verification process such as Second Factor Authentication (2FA).

Do not trust shared laptops or public computers. Additionally, if you're using a private or incognito window in your browser, 
keep in mind that it's temporary and should **not** be considered a secure or permanent environment: then do not trust it.

## When should I trust a device?

You should trust a device when it meets several criteria, including: 

- strong security measures,
- an updated operating system,
- effective antivirus,
- proven ownership being recognised by the service provider, and
- being physically secured to prevent unauthorised access.

## What are the benefits to have a trusted device?

Using a trusted device will simplify your login process. For example, if a device is not trusted, 2FA needs to be used at every login. However, if you login using a trusted device, you will not have to use your 2FA for 7 days on the same device.

## What name shall I give to my trusted device?

You should name your trusted device something that helps you identify it and differentiates it from your other devices. Each name should be unique (e.g. the process will fail if a name is used more than once). 
Good names are descriptive but also personal, such as "My Personal Laptop" or "Sarah's iPhone." 
Avoid names such as "My Favorite Device", as that could make it harder to manage if you have multiple trusted devices for the same account.
