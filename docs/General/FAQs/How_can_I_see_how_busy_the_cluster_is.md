You can get the current status of all nodes on a cluster using the
command `sinfo`, you will get a printout like the following.

*The nodelist column has been truncated for readability*

Each partition has a row for every state it's nodes are currently in.

For example, the `large` partition currently has  **1** `down` node, 
**133** `mixed` nodes,  **7** `allocated` nodes and  **85** `idle`
nodes.

The most common node states you are likely to see are:

|  State      | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `idle`      | All CPUs on this node are unallocated and available for use.                                                                                              |
| `allocated` | All CPUs on this node are currently allocated.                                                                                                            |
| `mixed`     | Some CPUs on this node are unallocated, smaller jobs are likely to land here.                                                                             |
| `down`      | The node is unavailable for use                                                                                                                           |
| `reserved`  | This node has been reserved, and is only available for some users (in the case of the igpu partition, please contact NeSI support if you wish to use it). |
| `draining`  | Jobs are currently running on this node, but is not available for new jobs.                                                                               |

If you are interested in the state of one partition in particular you
may want to use the command `squeue -p <partition>` to get the current
queue of the partition `<partition> `.
