If you have no longer access to your authenticator application (e.g. change of device), you may need to re-enroll your device.

1. On the screen where you are prompted for your 6-digit code, click 'Reset code'

**Nat to update with new screenshot with new terminology when decided**

!!! warning "Not seeing this page?"
   If you perviously confirmed your device as 'Trusted', you will not be prompted for further authentication.
   In order to see the option to reset, open the link in a private/incognito session.
   
2. You will be redirected to a window for confirmation. Your username should be pre-populated, if this is not the case, enter your username and click send.

5. Follow the instructions to configure your authentication credentials.
