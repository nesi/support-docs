## How the portal works

NeSI is using product portals to share product features, ideas and
invite feedback from users.

### Cards on the portal

The Portal presents a number of “features” or “ideas” that you can
provide feedback on. Each idea/feature on the Portal is represented as a
“card”.

### Submit feedback/ideas

Select a card, choose the importance and add let us know why this is
important to you as well as your email address.

### Submit new idea

You can also submit brand new ideas on the Portal. These will be routed
to our Insights board as well and reviewed by the product management
team.

### What happens to the feedback?

Any submission will reach our Insights inbox. We will review and action
the feedback accordingly.

When appropriate, a portal card will be updated or created and published
so other users can upvote the idea. Once we've reached a decision, an
update can be sent to all users who voted for a feature on the Portal,
or to all these users as well as anyone who provided an insight that was
linked to the feature.
