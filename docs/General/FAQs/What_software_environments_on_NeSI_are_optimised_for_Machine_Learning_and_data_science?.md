When using NeSI's [HPC
platform](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/sections/360000034335),
you can bring your own code to install or you can access our extensive
software library which is already built and compiled, ready for you to
use. 

Examples of software environments on NeSI optimised for data science
include:

-   [R](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/209338087-R) and [Python](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000990436) users
    can get right into using and exploring the several built-in packages
    or create custom code.

-   [Jupyter on NeSI
    ](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001555615-Jupyter-on-NeSI)is
    particularly well suited to artificial intelligence and machine
    learning workloads. [R
    Studio](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360004337836)
    and/or Conda can be accessed via Jupyter.
