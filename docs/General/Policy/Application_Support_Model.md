Our policy for management of scientific application software is
based on the following principles:

- We will install and maintain software in a central location if it
    will be useful to a number of users, or if the effort to install it
    is small.
- Users may install software in their `/home` or `/nesi/project/`
 directories, provided that they have a license for the software (if
    needed) that permits the software to be used on NeSI systems.
- We will provide users with a reasonable amount of help when they
    are installing their own software.
