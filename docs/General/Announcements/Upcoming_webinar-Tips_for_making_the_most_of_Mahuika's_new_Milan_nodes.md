In late 2022, the Mahuika cluster was expanded to allow a wider range of
research communities to adopt HPC approaches and build digital skills
within their research teams.

Join us on Thursday 30 March for a short webinar sharing some practical
tips and tricks for making the most of these new resources:

**Making the most of Mahuika's new Milan nodes
Thursday 30 March**
**11:30 am - 12:00 pm**
**[Click here to

*Background:*
Following a successful early access programme, Mahuika’s newest CPU
nodes are now available for use by any projects that have a Mahuika
allocation on NeSI's HPC Platform. The production launch of these new
nodes is an exciting milestone in NeSI’s strategy to lower the carbon
footprint and continually improve the performance and fit-for-purpose
design of our platforms to meet your research needs.

*What’s new*

-   faster, more powerful computing, enabled by AMD 3rd Gen EPYC Milan
architecture

-   specialised high-memory capabilities, allowing rapid simultaneous
processing

-   improved energy efficiency - these nodes are 2.5 times more power
efficient than Mahuika’s original Broadwell nodes

Come along to [this
webinar](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/webinar-making-the-most-of-mahuikas-new-milan-nodes-registration-557428302057)
to learn more and to ask questions about how your research project can
use these powerful resources.
