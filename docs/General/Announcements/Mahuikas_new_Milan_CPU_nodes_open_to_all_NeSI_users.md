Following a successful early access programme, Mahuika’s newest CPU
nodes are now available for use by any projects that have a Mahuika
allocation on NeSI's HPC Platform.

The production launch of these new nodes is an exciting milestone in
NeSI’s strategy to lower the carbon footprint and continually improve
the performance and fit-for-purpose design of our platforms to meet your
research needs.

## What’s new

- faster, more powerful computing, enabled by AMD 3rd Gen EPYC Milan
    architecture

- specialised high-memory capabilities, allowing rapid simultaneous
    processing

- improved energy efficiency - these nodes are 2.5 times more power
    efficient than Mahuika’s original Broadwell nodes
