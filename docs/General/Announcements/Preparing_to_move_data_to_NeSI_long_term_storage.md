_Updated on 07 April 2025_

We’re nearly ready to welcome you onto Freezer, NeSI’s [new long-term storage platform](https://www.nesi.org.nz/case-studies/deeper-dive-nesis-platform-refresh-part-1). The initial storage offering on this new platform replaces our current Nearline service and will offer a similar long-term tape-based solution storing a single copy of data.

Below are important details about our transition from Nearline and our plan for welcoming you onto Freezer. 

## Help us streamline migration

We’re currently migrating your data from Nearline to Freezer so that it is ready and waiting for you on the new platform. To ensure this process runs as efficiently and quickly as possible, please refrain from writing new data or recalling any data after Friday 11 April. 

If you have an urgent need to write or recall data beyond 11 April, contact [NeSI Support](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz).

## Scheduled outage of Nearline

To support our transition to Freezer, we’re scheduling a Nearline service outage starting on Monday 14 April. We expect this outage to last about two weeks, during which you will not be able to read or write data to/from Nearline. 

If you have regular workflows that use Nearline or anticipate needing to read or write data to Nearline during the outage, [get in touch with us](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz) so that we can help you prepare.

## Transitioning to Freezer

To provide more time to complete our migration of data to Freezer, we are working with NIWA to host the NeSI tapes (holding data for the Nearline service) within NIWA’s tape library. This will enable read access to your data after the Nearline outage if required. We expect this transitional phase to last until mid to late May. 

If you have an urgent need to read/write to your Nearline data during this transitional phase, please [reach out to us](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz).  

_Read/write access during the transition period:_


| Phase                                         | Read access                           | Read/write access                        |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Current                                   | available                             | available until 11 April                |
| Preparing for Nearline outage (11-14 April)| no new read access, but existing jobs will be allowed to finish | no new read/write access, existing jobs will finish |

| Nearline service outage (14 April - 28 April) and physical tape migration | not available                         | not available                            |

| Transitional phase (starting May 1)       | available                             | not available                            |
| Freezer service available (estimate: mid to late May) | available                             | available                                |


## Data management during transition

The current tapes from Nearline will form part of NIWA’s new long-term storage offering, Rapids. Once all Nearline data has been migrated to NeSI’s Freezer service, its metadata will be removed from Rapids, and over time, the tape storage media will be over-written. This means that the data will be inaccessible on NIWA’s service, however the data itself may be retained until eventual destruction by NIWA when the tapes are decommissioned. We are working with NIWA to ensure that suitable protections are in place and that the data is managed appropriately.

## We're here to support you
