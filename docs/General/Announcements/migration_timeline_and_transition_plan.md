During May and June, we're all moving to the new platforms. [Watch the announcement](https://youtu.be/EBDwWN6Fsas?si=rSV8SxfzmUZi5NcG).

This is our latest advanced HPC and AI platform designed to underpin a diverse array of computational and data sciences. It brings a rich and high performance platform into the hands of researchers across Aotearoa New Zealand, backed by the same friendly NeSI team for support and training. We’re looking forward to working with you all to take advantage of what it offers.

 

## Migration timeline

_Updated 15 May 2025_

During May & June, we’re all moving to the new platforms. Here’s our current timeline:

* **5 May** – Onboard early access users - reach out to support@nesi.org.nz if you’re keen on jumping in.
* **8 May onwards** – No new projects or allocations or users will start on Māui or Mahuika. These requests will be allocated on the new platforms to start from 1 June.
* **15 May** – All users with existing NeSI HPC allocations can log in to the new platforms. Before you start, [visit this page](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/General/Announcements/HPC3/).
* **26 May** - All jobs on Milan partition / HGX GPU nodes **must finish by this date**. Access to Māui HPC platform ends.
* **late May / early June** – Freezer, NeSI's new [long-term data storage platform](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Storage/Long_Term_Storage/Freezer_long_term_storage/), is available.
* **1 June onwards** – Onboard new projects (projects, users, allocations).
* **13 June** - Access to Mahuika HPC platform ends.

_Note: An outage previously scheduled for May 19-20 has been postponed. We will update the timeline when the new outage date is confirmed._

!!! info
    From 26 May to early June, we are physically moving parts of the computing infrastructure from Wellington to Auckland. 
    During that time, capacity will fluctuate and there will be periods of longer queue wait times and slower throughput of work. 
    If you’re worried about that, email support@nesi.org.nz and we’ll see what we can do to support you.

 
## Get ready to migrate

_Confirm the data you want copied across_

- `/home` and `/project` directories are already copied to the new storage and are being continuously updated to capture any changes you’re making. 
- By default, `/nesi/nobackup` is not migrated. If you want any of this data, you can override the default and force data to be copied. [Follow the instructions here](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Storage/File_Systems_and_Quotas/Moving_to_the_new_filesystem/) so that you have everything you need for starting work on the new platforms. Email support@nesi.org.nz if you need help.

_Stay up to date_

- Dates in our timeline are subject to change. 
- For ongoing updates check your inbox and follow our support channels (eg. [system status](https://status.nesi.org.nz/), [support docs](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/), etc.)
- Our online [Office Hours](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Getting_Help/Weekly_Online_Office_Hours/) are also the perfect place to ask any questions (big or small!)
- Reach out to work one-on-one with us to resolve any issues - support@nesi.org.nz
