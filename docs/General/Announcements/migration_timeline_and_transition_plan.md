This week we are excited to announce the dates we’re migrating to our new platforms - [watch the announcement](https://youtu.be/EBDwWN6Fsas?si=rSV8SxfzmUZi5NcG).

This is our latest advanced HPC and AI platform designed to underpin a diverse array of computational and data sciences. It brings a rich and high performance platform into the hands of researchers across Aotearoa New Zealand, backed by the same friendly NeSI team for support and training. We’re looking forward to working with you all to take advantage of what it offers.

 

## Migration timeline

During May & June, we’re all moving to the new platforms. Here’s our current timeline. From Next Week:

* **5 May** – Onboard early access users - reach out to support@nesi.org.nz if you’re keen on jumping in.
* **8 May** onwards – No new projects or allocations or users will start on Māui or Mahuika. These requests will be allocated on the new platforms to start from 1 June
* Week of **12 May** – Onboard all users with existing NeSI HPC allocations
* **19/20 May** - [Outage](https://status.nesi.org.nz/incidents/3y3ttj57fts6) to move our user identity and project admin platforms. Impacts:
    * Mahuika and Māui HPC clusters will be unaffected for ssh users
    * Users will not be able to login to my.nesi.org.nz or use interactive compute services (OnDemand, Jupyter)
    * Users will not be able to log-in to the new HPC platform (running jobs will be unaffected)
* **23 May** - Access to Māui HPC platform is closed off
* **1 June** onwards – Onboard new projects (projects, users, allocations)
* **13 June** - Access to Mahuika HPC platform is closed off


!!! info
    We are physically moving parts of the computing infrastructure from Wellington to Auckland. 
    During that time, capacity will fluctuate and there will be periods of longer queue wait times and slower throughput of work. 
    If you’re worried about that, get in touch and we’ll see what we can do to support you.

 
## Get ready to migrate

_Confirm the data you want copied across_

- `/home` and `/project` directories are already copied to the new storage and are being continuously updated to capture any changes you’re making. 
- By default, `/nesi/nobackup` is not migrated. If you want any of this data, you can override the default and force data to be copied. [Follow the instructions](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Storage/File_Systems_and_Quotas/Moving_to_the_new_filesystem/) here so that you have everything you need for starting work on the new platforms. Email support@nesi.org.nz if you need help.

_Tour the platform_

- Join us on 15 May at 1:00pm ([register here](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/platform-refresh-update-getting-started-on-the-new-platforms-registration-1347251127389?aff=oddtdtcreator)) for a walk-through of how to get started on the new platforms. We’ll show you what’s changed, what’s the same, and answer any questions.

_Stay up to date_

- Dates are subject to change
- For ongoing updates check your inbox and follow our support channels (eg. [system status](https://status.nesi.org.nz/), [support docs](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/), etc.)
- Our online [Office Hours](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Getting_Help/Weekly_Online_Office_Hours/) are also the perfect place to ask any questions (big or small!)
- Reach out to work one-on-one with us to resolve any issues - support@nesi.org.nz
