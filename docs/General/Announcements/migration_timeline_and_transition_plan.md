We are nearly ready to welcome you onto our new platforms at the Tāmaki Data Centre. While we’re still finalising the exact dates, we wanted to give you an early heads-up of some timelines so you can prepare.

We’re targeting the following timeframes for migration to the new platforms:

- Start of May - Onboard early access users
- Early-May to early-June - Migrate all projects
- Late-May - Retire components of NeSI’s platforms in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington and migrate equipment to Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland.

To ensure a smooth process, we’re managing the migration in stages to avoid any lengthy outages. You will notice longer queue times in late May through June, but we’re here to support you every step of the way to minimise delays to your work.

Join us for a progress update on 01 May where we’ll share more details about the transition process and can answer any questions you may have:

It’s taken a lot of hard work to get to this point and we can’t wait for you to experience everything these new platforms have to offer. If you missed our last progress update, you can catch up here.
