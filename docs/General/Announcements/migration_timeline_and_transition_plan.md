NeSI’s new HPC and AI platforms are ready for you! 

This is your green light to move onto faster, more powerful infrastructure designed for the future of research computing in Aotearoa New Zealand.

[Watch our demo of the new tools](https://youtu.be/EBDwWN6Fsas?si=rSV8SxfzmUZi5NcG).

This migration brings a rich and high performance platform into the hands of researchers, backed by the same trusted and friendly NeSI team for support and training. 

We’re looking forward to working with you all to take advantage of what it offers.

## The final countdown begins, so let’s work together

Mahuika and Māui are scheduled to be shut down over the coming weeks (see our timeline below) so it’s time to get moving.

* **You can login to the new platforms today.** We’ve put in the preparation for you – environments are set up, applications tested, data migrated – so jump in and get started. We’re working to optimise things iteratively so your activity helps us pinpoint what to improve next. 

* **The earlier you migrate the smoother the transition will be.** We love working alongside you and resolving issues together. To keep doing that well, we need to work with you now so we’re not troubleshooting under pressure later.

## Get started 

*  Follow our guide to start working on the new platforms
*  Log in and validate your workflows. Try everything to ensure all works as expected. Any issues, email support@nesi.org.nz.
*  Once you’re ready to work completely on the new platforms, [follow these instructions](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Storage/File_Systems_and_Quotas/Moving_to_the_new_filesystem/#stopping-the-data-migration) to end our automated data syncronisation from Mahuika.
*  Need help? Our team is ready to support you [by email](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz) or [on a call](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Getting_Help/Weekly_Online_Office_Hours/).

## What to expect next

*  We’ll begin weekly email updates to support your transition
*  We’ll start sharing release notes and progress updates on improvements to tools & systems
*  In a few weeks we’ll report back with transition metrics, and we’d love to include your success in that.

 

## Migration timeline

During May & June, we’re all moving to the new platforms. Here’s our current timeline:

* **5 May** – Onboard early access users - reach out to support@nesi.org.nz if you’re keen on jumping in.
* **8 May** onwards – No new projects or allocations or users will start on Māui or Mahuika. These requests will be allocated on the new platforms to start from 1 June.
* **15 May** – All users with existing NeSI HPC allocations can log in to the new platforms. Before you start, [visit this page](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/General/Announcements/HPC3/).
* **26 May** - All jobs on Milan partition must finish by this date. Access to Māui HPC platform is closed off.
* **late May / early June** – Freezer, NeSI's new [long-term data storage platform](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Storage/Long_Term_Storage/Freezer_long_term_storage/), is available.
* **1 June** onwards – Onboard new projects (projects, users, allocations).
* **13 June** - Access to Mahuika HPC platform is closed off.

_Note: An outage previously scheduled for May 19-20 has been postponed. We will update the timeline when the new outage date is confirmed._

!!! info
    We are physically moving parts of the computing infrastructure from Wellington to Auckland. 
    During that time, capacity will fluctuate and there will be periods of longer queue wait times and slower throughput of work. 
    If you’re worried about that, get in touch and we’ll see what we can do to support you.

 
## Stay up to date

*  Dates in our timeline are subject to change.
*  For ongoing updates check your inbox and follow our support channels (eg. [system status](https://status.nesi.org.nz/), [support docs](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/), etc.)
*  Our online [Office Hours](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Getting_Help/Weekly_Online_Office_Hours/) are also the perfect place to ask any questions (big or small!)
*  Reach out to work one-on-one with us to resolve any issues - support@nesi.org.nz
