## Before you Start

Before using the new cluster, please read all of:

- [Differences between Mahuika and the new HPC](../FAQs/Mahuika_HPC3_Differences.md)
- [Known Issues on the new HPC](Known_Issues_HPC3.md) - Are we ready for *your* workflow?
- [Using the new copy of your data](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Storage/File_Systems_and_Quotas/Moving_to_the_new_filesystem/#using-the-new-weka-copy-of-your-data) (a section of the [Data Migration](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Storage/File_Systems_and_Quotas/Moving_to_the_new_filesystem/) page)
    - Do your new files keep disappearing? Check that you've [stopped the synchronisation of your data](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Storage/File_Systems_and_Quotas/Moving_to_the_new_filesystem/#halting-the-synchronisation-from-gpfs-entirely)
- [Standard Terminal setup on the new platform](../../Scientific_Computing/Terminal_Setup/Standard_Terminal_Setup.md)
