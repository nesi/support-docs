As another busy year draws to a close, NeSI’s Support Team will be
taking a summer break from **5:00 PM on 20 December 2024 to 9:00 am on
06 January 2024**

During this time, [NeSI platform services](https://status.nesi.org.nz/)
will be online and available, but non-critical support requests will be
responded to when the team is back on 06 January.

Urgent / critical requests will be addressed on a best effort basis. Any
changes to system status will be reported via our [System Status
page](https://status.nesi.org.nz/ "https://status.nesi.org.nz/") and
alerts.

A quick reminder of our main support channels as well as other sources
of self-service support:

- {% include "partials/support_request.html" %}
    Note: non-emergency requests will be addressed on or after 06 January 2025.

- [Sign up for NeSI system status
    updates](../../Getting_Started/Getting_Help/System_status.md) for
    advance warning of any system updates or unplanned outages.

- [Consult our User
    Documentation](https://www.docs.nesi.org.nz) pages
    for instructions and guidelines for using the systems

- [Visit NeSI’s YouTube
    channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvbRzoDQPkuGMWazx5LPA6y8Ji6tyl0Sp "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvbRzoDQPkuGMWazx5LPA6y8Ji6tyl0Sp") for
    introductory training webinars

On behalf of the entire NeSI team, we wish you a safe and relaxing
holiday.
