## Migration timeline

During May & June, we’re all moving to the new platforms. Here’s our current timeline:

- **From 5 May** – Onboard early access users - reach out to support@nesi.org.nz if you’re keen on jumping in.
- **8 May onwards** – No new projects or allocations or users will start on Māui or Mahuika. These requests will be allocated on the new platforms to start from 1 June
- **Week of 12 May** – Onboard all users with existing NeSI HPC allocations
- **19/20 May** - [Outage](https://status.nesi.org.nz/incidents/3y3ttj57fts6) to move our user identity and project admin platforms. Impacts:
  - Mahuika and Māui HPC clusters will be unaffected for ssh users
  - Users will not be able to login to my.nesi.org.nz or use interactive compute services (OnDemand, Jupyter)
  - Users will not be able to log-in to the new HPC platform (running jobs will be unaffected)
- **23 May** - Access to Māui HPC platform is closed off
- **1 June onwards** – Onboard new projects (projects, users, allocations)
- **13 June** - Access to Mahuika HPC platform is closed off


!!! info "Note"
    We are physically moving parts of the computing infrastructure from Wellington to Auckland. 
    During that time, capacity will fluctuate and there will be periods of longer queue wait times and slower throughput of work. 
    If you’re worried about that, email support@nesi.org.nz and we’ll see what we can do to support you.
