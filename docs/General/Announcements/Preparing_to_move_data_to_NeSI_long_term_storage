As part of NeSI’s [shift to new platforms]("https://www.nesi.org.nz/platform-refresh"), our long-term storage service is changing. Our new platform will address diverse data management needs across various research fields, and deliver an easier-to-use and scaleable storage tool. We’ll be sharing more details soon.   

The initial storage offering on this new platform is a replacement for the current Nearline service. Called NeSI Freezer, it will initially offer a similar long-term tape-based solution storing a single copy of data. We will look at the roadmap for this service once we’ve completed migration.

We will begin migrating Nearline data to NeSI Freezer starting this week. We will move data in stages and will contact you individually when we are ready to move your project.

##What’s involved

To ensure there is no risk of losing your data, we will verify that all steps in the migration process were successful before removing your data from Nearline.

Steps involved:

- We will migrate your project data on your behalf from Nearline to NeSI Freezer. 
- You can continue to read and write data to/from Nearline during the migration.
- Once all Nearline data has been migrated and our NeSI Freezer service is officially brought online, we will be in contact to help you get started on the new system.

##Questions? 

We have an FAQ page to help answer common questions and weekly Online Office Hours with our support team, who are ready to answer or talk through any questions or issues you might have. You can also reach out anytime via email.

We are ready to work with you ensure this transition is a smooth process and the new storage platform delivers an improved experience.
