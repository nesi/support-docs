## What is happening?

As part of the science system reforms, effective 01 July the *Crown Research Institutes* (CRIs) are merging into three new
*Public Research Organisations* (PROs):

- **Bioeconomy**: A merger of AgResearch, Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research, Plant & Food Research, and Scion.
- **Earth Science**: A merger of NIWA and GNS Science.
- **Health and Forensic Science**: A repurpose of ESR.

All researchers and staff of these new PROs will have new emails affiliated with their new organisation.
What this means for your NeSI account
There is currently no link between your new domain name (eg. name@agresearch.co.nz and name@bioeconomy.nz) and your existing NeSI account.

For the time being, you should continue to use your old / existing NeSI login credentials with your CRI email addresses (eg. name@agresearch.co.nz ) when accessing NeSI systems. Eventually, your new PRO domain & email will be mapped to your NeSI home directory.

## Logging in via Tuakiri

If you have used Tuakiri to login and it defaults to your new PRO as your Identity Provider (IdP) selection, you can change this by navigating to the [landing page of the directory system](https://directory.tuakiri.ac.nz/discovery). This page shows you the current saved selection and allows you to clear it.

If you have issues logging in or navigating to your home directory, {% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
