## What is happening

As part of the science system reforms, effective 01 July the *Crown Research Institutes* (CRIs) are merging into three new
*Public Research Organisations* (PROs):

- **Bioeconomy Science Institute**: A merger of AgResearch, Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research, Plant & Food Research, and Scion.
- **Earth Sciences New Zealand**: A merger of NIWA, GNS Science, MetService, and Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand.
- **Public Health and Forensic Science**: A repurpose of the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR).

All researchers and staff of these new PROs will have new emails affiliated with their new organisation.

## What this means for your HPC Platform account

There is currently no link between your new domain name (e.g. name@agresearch.co.nz and name@bioeconomy.nz) and your existing NeSI account.

For the time being, you should continue to use your old / existing login credentials using your CRI email addresses (e.g. name@agresearch.co.nz ) when accessing our HPC Platform. Eventually, your new PRO domain & email will be mapped to your home directory on Mahuika.

## Logging in via Tuakiri

If you have used Tuakiri to login and it defaults to your new PRO as your Identity Provider (IdP) selection, you can change this by navigating to the [landing page of the directory system](https://directory.tuakiri.ac.nz/discovery). This page shows you the current saved selection and allows you to clear it.

If you have issues logging in or navigating to your home directory, {% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
