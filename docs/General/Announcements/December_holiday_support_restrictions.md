With Christmas and the New Year period fast approaching, we wanted to outline our support restrictions and office closure period.

During this time, our [Network and HPC Platform services](https://www.reannz.co.nz/products-and-services) remain fully available, however urgent / critical support requests will be addressed on a best effort basis. Any changes to the HPC Platform's status will be reported via our [System Status page](https://status.nesi.org.nz/). Non-urgent support requests will be addressed once the REANNZ Office reopens.

## REANNZ Office shut down

START: 5:00pm 23 December 2025

END: 9:00am 5 January 2026
