The NeSI policy for management of scientific application software is
based on the following principles:

-   NeSI will install and maintain software in a central location if it
    will be useful to a number of users, or if the effort to install it
    is small.
-   Users may install software in their `/home` or `/nesi/project/`
    directories, provided that they have a license for the software (if
    needed) that permits the software to be used on NeSI systems.
-   NeSI will provide users with a reasonable amount of help when they
    are installing their own software.

In more detail: Application software will be supported using a
three-tier model.

## Tier 1

../../../ applications (meaning tools, libraries and science
applications) which:

1.  Have a wide user base among users of the NeSI Compute and Analytics
    Service, either because they are used by many users within one or
    many Projects or are easy to install.
2.  Are centrally installed, tested (including scaling), optimised,
    documented and upgraded as new versions become available.
3.  The NeSI Applications and/or Computational Science Team staff often
    (but not always) have in-depth knowledge of the application science
    – in which case they can provide specialist support to researchers.
    However, if no in-depth knowledge is available in the team(s), this
    does not prevent an application from being in Tier 1.
4.  Support documentation will be provided, including licensing
    information and scaling data etc.

## Tier 2

../../../ applications (meaning tools, libraries and science
applications) which:

1.  Have a small but important user base, meaning they are used by
    several users and 1 or several projects.
2.  Are centrally installed, standard regression tests are applied (if
    provided/available) and will be upgraded upon user request and as
    time permits.
3.  NeSI Applications and/or Computational Science Team staff have no
    “in depth” knowledge of the application.
4.  The support documentation provides basic information on how to use
    the software.

## Tier 3

../../../ applications (meaning tools, libraries and science
applications) that are required by one user, or have very limited use,
in which case:

1.  NeSI will (if required) provide limited guidance to the user so that
    they can install the software in their home directory.
2.  The user will be responsible for managing this software
3.  No support documentation will be provided by NeSI
4.  The software will not be listed in the software catalogue

NeSI will publish the current list of software (including all versions),
with links to the Support documentation.

 

<!--<p>Applications for central installation of new software on the NeSI systems (post initial implementation on the new platforms) will be made via an <a href="#_Application_Installation_Request">Application Installation request form</a>, where sufficient information will need to be provided to enable NeSI to make a decision as to which Tier the software falls in.  Applications for Tier 1 support will require approval by NeSI Management (or as delegated, e.g. to Solutions or HPC Compute and Analytics lead’s).</p>-->
