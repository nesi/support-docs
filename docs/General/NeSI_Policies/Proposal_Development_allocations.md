A Proposal Development allocation is a short-term allocation of up to
2,000 compute units per month (on Mahuika) or 50 node-hours per month
(on Māui) or both, for up to six months. During your Proposal
Development allocation you can find out:

- whether your software can run on a [NeSI HPC](../../Scientific_Computing/The_NeSI_High_Performance_Computers/index.md),
- how your software scales to multiple cores or across compute nodes,
- approximately how many compute units or node hours your research
    project is likely to need.

If:

- you are new to NeSI or have not run this particular programme of
    research on a NeSI system before, and
- you work at a New Zealand institution that is not a NeSI
    collaborating institution, and
- we decide that your workflow is likely to be a good technical fit
    for our facilities,

it is likely that we will initially award your research programme a
Proposal Development allocation.

Once you have completed your Proposal Development allocation, you are
welcome to apply for a further allocation. If you are successful, the
project's next allocation will be from another of the [allocation
classes](../../General/NeSI_Policies/Allocation_classes.md).

The [How Applications are Reviewed](How_we_review_applications.md) section
provides additional important information for applicants.

To learn more about NeSI Projects, and to apply please review the
content of the section entitled [Applying for a NeSI Project](../../Getting_Started/Accounts-Projects_and_Allocations/Applying_for_a_new_NeSI_project.md).
