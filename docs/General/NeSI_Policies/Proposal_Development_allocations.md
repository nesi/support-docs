A Proposal Development allocation is a short-term allocation of up to
2,000 compute units per month (on Mahuika) or 50 node-hours per month
(on Māui) or both, for up to five months. During your Proposal
Development allocation you can find out:

-   whether your software can run on a [NeSI
    HPC](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/articles/360000175735),
-   how your software scales to multiple cores or across compute nodes,
-   approximately how many compute units or node hours your research
    project is likely to need.

If:

-   you are new to NeSI or have not run this particular programme of
    research on a NeSI system before, and
-   you work at a New Zealand institution that is not a NeSI
    collaborating institution, and
-   we decide that your workflow is likely to be a good technical fit
    for our facilities,

it is likely that we will initially award your research programme a
Proposal Development allocation.

Once you have completed your Proposal Development allocation, you are
welcome to apply for a further allocation. If you are successful, the
project\'s next allocation will be from another of the [allocation
classes](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000925176).
