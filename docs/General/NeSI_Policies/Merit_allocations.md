This is the highest award given for use of NeSI services. A Merit
allocation is intended for highly skilled research teams carrying out
high quality research funded via a peer review process that supports the
[New Zealand Government's Science
Goals](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/national-statement-of-science-investment/).
Merit allocations may be made for the HPC Compute & Analytics and
Consultancy services.

To be eligible for consideration for a Merit allocation, the application
must meet the following criteria:

-   The underpinning research programme (that requires access to NeSI
    HPC services to achieve the objectives of the research) must support
    the [Government’s Science
    Goals](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/national-statement-of-science-investment/).
-   To demonstrate research quality and alignment with national research
    priorities, the research funding must have come from a
    peer-reviewed, contestable process at an institutional, regional or
    national level.
    -   The following funding sources are likely to qualify:
        -   Research funds managed by the Ministry of Business,
            Innovation and Employment (MBIE)
        -   Health Research Council funding
        -   Royal Society of New Zealand funding, e.g. Marsden grants
        -   SSIF programme funding (previously known as CRI Core
            funding)
        -   Research programmes forming part of a National Science
            Challenge
        -   Research programmes forming part of a Centre of Research
            Excellence (CoRE)
        -   Other similar funding sources
    -   The following funding sources are unlikely to qualify:
        -   Privately funded research
        -   Research funded by a foreign government
-   The research grant or contract must cover the entire period for
    which an allocation of NeSI resources is sought.
-   The applicant must be a named investigator on the peer reviewed
    research grant or contract. If you are a student, we may at our
    discretion consider your application for a Merit award if your
    supervisor is a named investigator.
