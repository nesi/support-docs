The Postgraduate allocation class supports capability development of
postgraduate students enrolled at a New Zealand university.

To be considered for a Postgraduate allocation, your application must
satisfy the following criteria:

- You must be enrolled at a New Zealand degree-granting institution
    and working on a postgraduate research programme (e.g. PhD or
    Masters by research) approved by that institution. Applicants in
    undergraduate programmes (including Honours programmes) or graduate
    programmes based on coursework are not eligible.

Even if your application satisfies these criteria, we may not award your
project an allocation from the Postgraduate class:

- If your institution is a NeSI Collaborator or Subscriber, your
    project's allocation will most likely be made from your
    institution's entitlement.
- If you have not used an HPC previously, we may award your project a
    Proposal Development allocation first. In this case, your project
    may be considered for a Postgraduate allocation after your Proposal
    Development allocation is complete.
- Some allocation requests may be declined, or alternatively postponed
 until a later time, if there is insufficient computing capacity
    available to meet demand.
