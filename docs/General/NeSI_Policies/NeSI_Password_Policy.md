The NeSI password policy is as follows:

-   Your password must be at least 12 characters long
-   Your password must contain one or more characters from at least two
    of the following classes:
    -   uppercase letters
    -   lowercase letters
    -   numbers
    -   special characters (excluding '**&&lt;&gt;\\**')
-   Passwords expire after 2 years (730 days)
-   When resetting a password ensure that it is not similar to the
    previous password(s) as that will cause the new password to be
    rejected.
