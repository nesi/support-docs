Most New Zealand universities and Crown Research Institutes are members
of the [Tuakiri authentication
federation](https://www.reannz.co.nz/products-and-services/tuakiri/join/),
but many other institutions, including private sector organisations and
most central and local government agencies, are not. If you are not
affiliated with an organisation supported by the
[Tuakiri](https://www.reannz.co.nz/products-and-services/tuakiri/)
federation, you can request access via
[my.nesi.org.nz](https://my.nesi.org.nz/register).
