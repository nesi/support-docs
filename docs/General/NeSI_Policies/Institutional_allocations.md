Your project will typically be considered for an Institutional
allocation if you work for or study at one of the institutions that is a
NeSI collaborator, or has a subscription to our HPC Compute & Analytics
service. If you are unsure whether or not your institution has a current
subscription with NeSI, please ask us via [a support
request](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz).

Allocations from an institution's entitlement are subject to approval by
that institution. Some institutions require pre-approval or recover
costs for their HPC usage through internal charging. You are welcome to
begin the application process by [applying for a new project
online](https://my.nesi.org.nz/html/request_project/). Our team is happy
to answer any questions you may have through the application process,
and we will let you know if you are expected to directly seek approval
from your institution.

If you are a postgraduate student at a NeSI collaborator, your project
will likely be considered for an Institutional allocation rather than a
[Merit](../../General/NeSI_Policies/Merit_allocations.md) or
[Postgraduate](../../General/NeSI_Policies/Postgraduate_allocations.md)
allocation.

applications](../../General/NeSI_Policies/How_we_review_applications.md).
