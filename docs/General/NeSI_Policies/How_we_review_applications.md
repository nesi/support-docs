When you submit your application through our web site, it will go to our
technical support team for review. In general, our review process for
new projects is as follows:

1. **Initial check:** We see whether your proposal describes a
    legitimate research programme and whether your research programme
    will need some kind of advanced research computing capability (which
    may or may not be high-performance computing). We also check whether
    your project team is all assembled and has the skills needed to
    start using our systems (for example, basic familiarity with the
    Linux command line).  
    If you are a NIWA researcher, we will also confirm with NIWA's
    institutional point of contact that you have followed the
    [NIWA internal documentation for gaining access to the HPCs](https://one.niwa.co.nz/display/ONE/High+Performance+Computing+Facility+Services).
    You will only be able to access the NIWA internal documentation if
    you are currently behind the NIWA VPN or on NIWA's internal network.
2. **Software check:** One of our technical experts looks at the
    software you say you want to use and determines whether it can run
    on any of our systems and whether you are likely to be legally
    allowed to run the software on NeSI. This check is intended to cover
    both compatibility and licensing matters, as well as whether you are
    able and willing to compile or install the software yourself if
    necessary.
3. **Support check:** Some research programmes may have very demanding
    support needs. We will consider whether we are able to offer the
    kind and amount of support your team is likely to need to progress
    your research if we approve it. This check is especially important
    if we think you are likely to want or need to change someone else's
    code. We may consult with our scientific programmers at this point,
    and find out whether your project is likely to be eligible for our
    consultancy service.
4. **Disk space check:** We decide how much disk space your project is
    likely to need in the persistent storage (project directory) and
    scratch storage (nobackup directory). We may unfortunately have to
    reject (or negotiate for less storage) if your disk space needs
    would interfere with our ability to provide good service to other
    research teams.
5. **Facility:** Based on the information in your application, we
    decide whether your workflow is best suited for Mahuika, Māui or
    both, and also whether your project would benefit from an allocation
    of GPU hours or access to ancillary nodes or virtual labs.
6. **Decision and notification:** If we approve an initial allocation
    for your project, we will typically award the project an
    [allocation of Mahuika compute units, Māui node hours, or both, and also an online storage allocation](../../Getting_Started/Accounts-Projects_and_Allocations/What_is_an_allocation.md),
    from one of [our allocation classes](../../General/NeSI_Policies/Allocation_classes.md).
    In an case, we will send you an email telling you about our decision.

Our review process for requests for new allocations on existing projects
is simpler:

1. **Eligibility check:** We look at the information you have given us
    (and may ask you more questions) to find out which of our regular
    allocation classes
    ([Merit](Merit_allocations.md),
    [Postgraduate](Postgraduate_allocations.md)
    or
    [Institutional](Institutional_allocations.md))
    this research programme is eligible to receive. Your research
    programme may be eligible for more than one allocation class.
2. **Amount and duration:** We will calculate the approximate amount of
    compute resources you are likely to need based on what kind of
    allocation you most recently received and your usage history. We may
    suggest an allocation size (i.e. a number of Mahuika compute units
    or Māui node hours) and a duration of up to 12 months, and give you
    a chance to provide feedback if you think our suggested allocation
    would not meet your needs.
3. **Choice of Class and Contention:** We will choose from which class
    to award your allocation, based on your research programme's
    eligibility for the different classes and whether your proposed
    allocation would exceed [any class-based allocation limits](Allocation_classes.md).
    We may change this choice depending on which classes, if any, are
    under contention.
4. **Approval:** If we decide that your project should be considered
    for an Institutional allocation, the request may need to be approved
    by a representative of the project's host institution, which is the
    institution where the project owner works or studies.
5. **Decision and notification:** We will send you an email telling you
    about our decision.

From time to time we may have to decline requests for allocations of
computing resources. If we can't grant your research programme an
allocation because of contention or because the project's host
institution has disallowed the allocation, this is not to be taken as a
judgement on the merit of your research topic or the quality of your
team's work.
