The NeSI access policy, agreed by representatives of the Crown and
NeSI's partner institutions, establishes several allocation classes. In
general terms, the allocation class granted to your project is used to
decide who pays for that aspect of your project's consumption of NeSI
services.

<tr class="odd">
<td rowspan="4" style="width: 34.4%"><h3 id="prop"><a
href="../../General/NeSI_Policies/Proposal_Development_allocations.md">Proposal
Development</a></h3>
<p>A short-term allocation available to researchers from any New Zealand
research institution. During this allocation you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out whether your software works on one of the NeSI
platforms.</li>
<li>See how your software scales when you run it on more
processors.</li>
<li>Start estimating how many core hours per year you will need for your
project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your Proposal Development allocation is well underway (or has
ended), you are welcome to apply for a further allocation, which will be
granted from one of our other allocation classes.</p>
<p><em>Depending on your institutional affiliation and your project's
satisfaction of eligibility criteria, your project's initial allocation
may have the same limits as a Proposal Development allocation but be
from one of our other allocation classes.</em></p></td>

<p>Intended for highly skilled research teams carrying out high quality

<p>A named investigator on a peer reviewed research grant or contract
covering the entire allocation period. Students under the supervision of
a named investigator are eligible at NeSI's discretion.</p>

If you only qualify for a Proposal Development allocation right now,
please {% include "partials/support_request.html" %} before applying for a
new project. Our Engagement Team is happy to talk to you and
representatives of your institution about [Subscription
options](https://www.nesi.org.nz/community/partners-pricing#subscriptions).
It's best to start talking to us early as Subscription contracts can
take a while to set up.

Our team is happy to answer any questions you may have throughout the
application process.
