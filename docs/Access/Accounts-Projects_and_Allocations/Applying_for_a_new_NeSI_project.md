!!! prerequisite
    - Have a [NeSI Account profile](../../Getting_Started/Accounts-Projects_and_Allocations/Creating_a_NeSI_Account_Profile.md).
    - NIWA researchers only: read and follow the
        [NIWA internal documentation for gaining access to the HPCs](https://one.niwa.co.nz/display/ONE/High+Performance+Computing+Facility+Services)
        (this link is only valid from within the NIWA network or VPN).

!!! note "Preferred"
    - Assemble your project team.
    - Becoming familiar with the Linux command line. There are many
         courses and online materials available, such as [Software
         Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), to help
         you and your project team gain the necessary skills.
    - Become familiar with foundational HPC skills, for example by
         attending a NeSI introductory workshop, one of our [weekly
         introductory sessions (or watching the
         recording)](../../Getting_Started/Getting_Help/Introductory_Material.md),
         or having one or more of your project team members do so.
    - Review our [allocation classes](../../General/NeSI_Policies/Allocation_classes.md). If
         you don't think you currently qualify for any class other than
         Proposal Development, please {% include "partials/support_request.html" %} as soon as
         possible to discuss your options. Your institution may be in a
         position to buy a subscription from us while your Proposal
         Development allocation is in effect if they do not already possess
         one.

Requests to use NeSI resources are [submitted via a web
form](https://my.nesi.org.nz/). The NeSI team will endeavour to approve
your project, or contact you for more information, within 3-5 working
days of your submitting your project request.

!!! note
     If you are a member of NIWA please also ensure that you have also read
     and followed the
     [NIWA internal documentation for gaining access to the HPCs](https://one.niwa.co.nz/display/ONE/High+Performance+Computing+Facility+Services)
     before applying for your NeSI project. *You will only be able to
     access the link from behind the NIWA VPN.*
     Other institutions may also put in place, or vary, pre-approval
     processes from time to time. If you apply for a new project without
     having completed any necessary pre-approval steps, your application
     may be delayed more than usual, or we may notify you and ask you to
     obtain pre-approval from your institution.

## Information you will need to provide

During the application process, we will ask you for the following
information:

- Your name, institutional affiliation (i.e. your employer or place of
    study), role at your institution, a contact telephone number, and
    work email address
- The title of your proposed NeSI HPC Project, and a brief abstract
    describing your project's goals
- The scientific domain and field of study (i.e. subdomain) your
    project belongs to
- The date on which you plan to start your computational work on NeSI
    (not the start date of the research programme as a whole, or of the
    research programme's current or expected funding)
- Details of how your project is funded (this will help determine
    whether you are eligible for an allocation from our
    [Merit](../../General/NeSI_Policies/Merit_allocations.md) class)
- Your previous HPC experience
- Whether you would like expert scientific programming support on your
    project
- Who else will be working on the proposed NeSI HPC Project with you
- What software you intend to use on the NeSI HPCs.

You will also be given an opportunity to tell us anything else you think
is relevant.

!!! prerequisite "What Next?"
     - Your NeSI Project proposal will be
         [reviewed](../../General/NeSI_Policies/How_we_review_applications.md),
         after which you will be informed of the outcome.
     - We may contact you if further details are required.
     - When your project is approved you will be able to [set your Linux
         Password](../../Getting_Started/Accessing_the_HPCs/Setting_Up_and_Resetting_Your_Password.md).
