## New and Improved

- The project allocation request form now enables you to indicate if the request is for a new allocation with compute and storage or if the request is to update the storage of the current allocation.  
- Previously, the allocation form only listed "Persistent project disk space" as an available storage type. It now lists all [storage types available on NeSI](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Storage/File_Systems_and_Quotas/NeSI_File_Systems_and_Quotas/): 
    - Persistent project disk space  
    - Temporary project disk space   
    - Long-term storage space  
- The role of Primary Adviser has been removed from the list of possible roles that owners can assign new members of their projects. Roles available to choose from include: Contact Person, Grant PI, Owner, Supervisor and Team Member.  

If you have any questions about any of the updates, please
