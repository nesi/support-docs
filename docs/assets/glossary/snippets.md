IMPORTANT: The OpenSWR software rasteriser can use multiple threads for            best performance. The number of threads is controlled by the            environment variable KNOB_MAX_WORKER_THREADS. The module sets             KNOB_MAX_WORKER_THREADS=1             by default to avoid accidental oversubscription of nodes.
