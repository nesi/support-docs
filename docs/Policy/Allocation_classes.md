The allocation class granted to your project is used to decide who pays for that aspect of your project's consumption of REANNZ HPC services.

<tr >
<td rowspan="4" ><h2>Proposal Development</h2>
<p>A short-term allocation available to researchers from any New Zealand
research institution. During this allocation you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out whether your software works on one of the NeSI
platforms.</li>
<li>See how your software scales when you run it on more
processors.</li>
<li>Start estimating how many core hours per year you will need for your
project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your Proposal Development allocation is well underway (or has
ended), you are welcome to apply for a further allocation, which will be
granted from one of our other allocation classes.</p>
<p><em>Depending on your institutional affiliation and your project's
satisfaction of eligibility criteria, your project's initial allocation
may have the same limits as a Proposal Development allocation but be
from one of our other allocation classes.</em></p></td>

<p>Intended for highly skilled research teams carrying out high quality
research funded via a peer review process that supports the New
Zealand Government's Science Goals</a>.</p>
<p>A named investigator on a peer reviewed research grant or contract
covering the entire allocation period. Students under the supervision of
a named investigator are eligible at our discretion.</p>
<p>Examples likely to qualify:</p>
<ul>
<li>MBIE managed research funds</li>
<li>Health Research Council funding</li>
<li>Royal Society of New Zealand funding, e.g. Marsden grants</li>
<li>SSIF programme funding (previously known as CRI Core funding)</li>
<li>Research programmes forming part of a Centre of Research Excellence
(CoRE)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Those engaged in privately funded research or research funded by
a foreign government are unlikely to qualify.</em></p></td>

to our services.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="warning">Warning</h2>
<p>If you are employed by and/or study at multiple institutions, it is
your responsibility to find out which of those institutions is
supporting your proposed work. Whether and how your research
is eligible to receive allocations of REANNZ HPC resources depends on its host
institution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allocations from an institution's entitlement are subject to approval
by that institution. Some institutions require pre-approval or recover
costs for their REANNZ HPC usage through internal charging.</p>
<p>If you are applying in your capacity as a staff member or student at
an institution that was a NeSI Collaborator, your project will be considered for an
Institutional allocation rather than a Merit or Postgraduate
allocation.</p></td>

Our Engagement Team is happy to talk to you and representatives of your institution about
[Subscription options](https://www.nesi.org.nz/community/partners-pricing#subscriptions).
It's best to start talking to us early as
[Subscription](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Service_Subscriptions/What_is_a_Subscription/) contracts can
take a while to set up.

Our team is happy to answer any questions you may have throughout the
application process.
