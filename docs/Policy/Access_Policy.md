Following the integration of NeSI and REANNZ, all aspects of NeSI delivery, including the previous Access Policy, are now the responsibility of REANNZ. 

If you have questions about this, {% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.

See our [current version of the Access Policy](https://www.nesi.org.nz/sites/default/files/media/NeSI%20Access%20Policy%203.0.pdf).

## What does this cover?

Our Access Policy provides essential information for researchers accessing the following services:

- [HPC and data analytics](https://www.reannz.co.nz/products-and-services/high-performance-computing-and-data-analytics) - a mix of traditional HPC offerings alongside cloud environments, programmable infrastructure, and specialised data science capabilities.
- [Consultancy](https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Getting_Help/Consultancy/) - scientific and HPC-focused computational and data science support provided to research projects across a range of domains.
- [Training](https://www.reannz.co.nz/products-and-services/training) – strengthening computational capability and sharing training expertise across New Zealand’s research communities.
